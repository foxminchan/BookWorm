## Usage Examples

### Merge After CI (Use Native GitHub Features)

Auto-merge is the recommended replacement for the deprecated `@dependabot merge` command:

```bash
# Enable auto-merge via GitHub CLI
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --auto --squash

# Or enable auto-merge via the GitHub UI:
# PR → "Enable auto-merge" → select merge method → confirm
```

GitHub will automatically merge the PR once all required CI checks pass.

### Ignore a Major Version Bump

```
@dependabot ignore this major version
```

Useful when a major version has breaking changes and migration is not yet planned.

### Check Active Ignore Conditions

```
@dependabot show express ignore conditions
```

Displays a table showing all ignore conditions currently stored for the `express` dependency.

### Unignore a Dependency in a Group

```
@dependabot unignore lodash
```

Closes the current grouped PR, clears all ignore conditions for `lodash`, and opens a new PR that includes available `lodash` updates.

### Unignore a Specific Condition

```
@dependabot unignore express [< 1.9, > 1.8.0]
```

Clears only the specified version range ignore for `express`.

## Tips

- **Rebase vs Recreate**: Use `rebase` to resolve conflicts while keeping your review state. Use `recreate` to start fresh if the PR has diverged significantly.
- **Force push over extra commits**: If you've pushed commits to a Dependabot branch and want Dependabot to rebase over them, include `[dependabot skip]` in your commit message.
- **Persistent ignores**: Ignore commands via PR comments are stored centrally. For transparency in team repos, prefer using `ignore` in `dependabot.yml` instead.
- **Merging Dependabot PRs**: Use GitHub's native auto-merge feature, the CLI (`gh pr merge`), or the web UI. The old `@dependabot merge` commands were deprecated in January 2026.
- **Closing/Reopening**: Use the GitHub UI or CLI. The old `@dependabot close` and `@dependabot reopen` commands were deprecated in January 2026.
- **Grouped commands**: When using `@dependabot unignore`, Dependabot closes the current PR and opens a fresh one with the updated dependency set.
