## Overview

The Catalog domain is responsible for managing the products that are available for purchase in the BookWorm platform and handling product ratings and reviews. It consists of two main services:

1. **Product Service**: Serves as the central repository for all book-related information including metadata, inventory status, pricing, and categorization. It allows customers to browse the extensive collection of books, view detailed product information, and search based on various criteria.

2. **Rating Service**: Manages customer reviews, ratings, and feedback for books in the catalog. It provides functionality for users to rate books, write reviews, and view aggregated rating statistics.

The domain provides robust management capabilities for product categories, series, collections, publishers, and user-generated content. It maintains relationships between books, such as series orders, related titles, author bibliographies, and user reviews.

For administrators, the Catalog domain offers comprehensive management tools for both product information and user-generated content, allowing them to:

- Add and update book information
- Manage inventory levels
- Control pricing and discounts
- Moderate user reviews and ratings
- Generate reports on product performance and user feedback

As a core domain in the BookWorm ecosystem, Catalog integrates with other services like the Basket domain for purchasing flows and the Ordering domain for inventory verification during checkout processes.
