## Overview

The Cancel Chat endpoint allows users to terminate an active chat session in the BookWorm platform. This endpoint accepts a chat's unique identifier (GUID) and cancels the associated chat session if it exists. It's designed to provide users with the ability to gracefully end chat interactions when needed.

The endpoint follows RESTful principles and returns a 204 No Content response upon successful cancellation, indicating that the request was processed successfully but no content needs to be returned.
