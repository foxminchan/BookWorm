## Overview

This endpoint enables the modification of an existing book entity in the catalog domain. Following Domain-Driven Design principles, it updates the aggregate root (Book) while maintaining its invariants and business rules. The operation is idempotent and will return appropriate error responses if the book ID does not exist or if business rules are violated. Updates will be propagated through domain events to maintain consistency across the system.

This endpoint respects the domain boundaries of the Catalog service and enables the modification of book attributes while preserving the entity's identity and integrity.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## PUT `(/api/v1/books/{id})`

### Parameters

- **id** (path) (required) - The unique identifier of the book to update (GUID format)
