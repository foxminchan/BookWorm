## Overview

The DELETE operation performs a soft delete of a book entity from the catalog domain. This endpoint enforces proper domain boundaries by validating the book's existence and ensuring there are no constraint violations before deletion.

The operation is idempotent - multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request, aligning with REST architectural constraints.

**Authorization**: Requires "ADMIN" role to maintain aggregate integrity.

**Domain Validation**:

- Validates book exists before deletion
- Performs a soft delete by marking the book as deleted rather than removing it from the database
- Returns 404 Not Found if the book doesn't exist

## Technical Details

### Implementation Notes

- Uses soft delete pattern through `ISoftDelete` interface
- Maintains audit trail through `AuditableEntity` base class
- Preserves data integrity while marking records as deleted
- Handled by `DeleteBookHandler` using CQRS pattern with MediatR

### Error Handling

The service implements robust error handling:

- Returns 404 if book is not found
- Returns 400 for invalid GUID format
- Returns 403 if user lacks admin privileges

## Implementation Details

The DELETE operation is implemented using the following components:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Endpoint
    participant Handler
    participant Repository
    participant Book

    Client->>Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/books/{id}
    Note over Endpoint: Validates admin authorization

    Endpoint->>Handler: Send(DeleteBookCommand)

    Handler->>Repository: GetByIdAsync(id)
    Repository-->>Handler: Book or null

    alt Book exists
        Handler->>Book: Delete()
        Note over Book: Sets IsDeleted = true
        Handler->>Repository: SaveEntitiesAsync()
        Handler-->>Endpoint: Unit.Value
        Endpoint-->>Client: 204 No Content
    else Book not found
        Handler-->>Endpoint: NotFoundException
        Endpoint-->>Client: 404 Not Found
    end
```
