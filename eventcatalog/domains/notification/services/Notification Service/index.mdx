## Overview

The Notification Service is a supporting service within BookWorm's microservices architecture, responsible for sending transactional emails to customers at critical points in the order lifecycle. Built using an event-driven approach, this service listens for integration events from other domains and transforms them into appropriate customer communications.

## Technical Implementation

The Notification Service is implemented using modern cloud-native practices:

### Email Providers

The service supports multiple email delivery mechanisms through a clean abstraction:

- **Development Environment**: Uses local SMTP server (MailPit) for testing
- **Production Environment**: Integrates with SendGrid for reliable email delivery
- **Interface Abstraction**: Implements `ISmtpClient` interface for provider flexibility

```csharp frame="terminal"
public interface ISmtpClient
{
    Task SendEmailAsync(MailMessage mailMessage, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### Resilience Patterns

The service implements robust resilience patterns to ensure message delivery:

```csharp
services.AddResiliencePipeline(
    nameof(Notification),
    pipelineBuilder =>
    {
        pipelineBuilder
            .AddRetry(
                new()
                {
                    ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<Exception>(),
                    BackoffType = DelayBackoffType.Exponential,
                    MaxRetryAttempts = 3,
                    Delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2),
                    UseJitter = true,
                }
            )
            .AddTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45));
    }
);
```

### Event Handlers

The service consumes integration events through MassTransit and processes them with dedicated handlers:

#### Order Completion Handler

```csharp frame="terminal"
[AsyncApi]
public sealed class CompleteOrderCommandHandler : IConsumer<CompleteOrderCommand>
{
    [Channel("notification-complete-order")]
    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<CompleteOrderCommand> context)
    {
        var message = context.Message;
        
        // Email sending logic
        const string subject = "Your order has been completed";
        var body = $"Your order with ID {message.OrderId} has been completed successfully. Total amount: {message.TotalMoney:C}";
        
        // Send email using the configured provider
    }
}
```

### Observability

The service integrates with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing:

```csharp
services.AddOpenTelemetry().WithTracing(t => 
    t.AddSource(TelemetryTags.ActivitySourceName));
```

## Message Flow

The Notification Service processes the following commands:

| Command | Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `PlaceOrderCommand` | notification-place-order | Sends order confirmation emails |
| `CompleteOrderCommand` | notification-complete-order | Sends order completion notifications |
| `CancelOrderCommand` | notification-cancel-order | Delivers order cancellation notices |

## Email Templates

Each notification type follows a standardized template structure:

- **Order Confirmation**: "Your order has been placed successfully."
- **Order Completion**: "Your order has been completed successfully."
- **Order Cancellation**: "Your order has been cancelled."

## Infrastructure

The Notification Service is deployed on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure Service Bus for message consumption and Azure Monitor for observability.

For `Development` environment, the service uses MailPit for email delivery.

For `Production` environment, the service uses SendGrid for email delivery.
