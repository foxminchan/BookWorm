## Overview

The Rating Service represents a distinct bounded context within the BookWorm ecosystem, responsible for managing user feedback and ratings for books. As a core domain service, it implements Domain-Driven Design principles to maintain a clean separation of concerns while providing critical functionality for the user experience.

### Key Responsibilities

- Collecting and storing user ratings and reviews
- Calculating aggregate rating metrics for books
- Validating feedback content against business rules
- Publishing domain events when feedback changes

### Domain Events

The service emits domain events such as `FeedbackCreatedEvent` and `FeedbackDeletedEvent` to notify other bounded contexts about changes in the rating domain. These events enable loose coupling between services while maintaining data consistency.

### Integration Points

Rating Service integrates with:

- **Catalog Service**: Updates book rating information
- **Notification Service**: Triggers notifications for review responses

### Implementation Details

The service follows the CQRS pattern with separate command and query models, enabling optimized read and write operations. The repository pattern is used for data access, ensuring persistence concerns remain separated from domain logic.
