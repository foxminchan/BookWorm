## Overview

The `FeedbackCreatedEvent` message is published by the Rating service to notify subscribers of a new feedback submission. This event is triggered when a user successfully submits a review or rating for a book within the BookWorm ecosystem. The event payload contains essential information about the feedback, including the user's identity, the book being reviewed, and the feedback content.
