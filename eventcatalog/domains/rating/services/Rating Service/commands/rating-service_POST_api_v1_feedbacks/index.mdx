## Overview

The `Create Feedback` endpoint allows users to submit reviews and ratings for books within the BookWorm ecosystem. This operation is part of the Rating domain's bounded context, responsible for managing user feedback and book evaluations.

### Domain Significance

In our domain model, `Feedback` represents a core aggregate that encapsulates:

- User evaluations (ratings on a defined scale)
- Textual reviews with content moderation rules
- Metadata about the feedback creator and timestamp
- Relationships to the Catalog domain via BookId

### Business Rules

- Users can only provide feedback for published books
- Feedback must include either a rating, a review, or both
- A user can submit only one feedback per book (subsequent submissions update existing feedback)
- Ratings must fall within the designated scale (1-5 stars)

### Integration Points

This endpoint interacts with the Catalog service to validate book existence and status before accepting feedback. The Rating service maintains its own projection of book data to minimize cross-service dependencies.
