## Overview

The `UserCheckedOutIntegrationEvent` is a critical integration event that signals the completion of a customer's checkout process in the BookWorm e-commerce system. This event serves as the primary trigger for initiating the order processing workflow across multiple services, particularly the Finance service which orchestrates the order state machine.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## Event Structure

The event contains the following key properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `OrderId` | `Guid` | Unique identifier for the newly created order |
| `BasketId` | `Guid` | Identifier of the basket being converted to an order |
| `Email` | `string?` | Customer's email address (optional) for notifications and order association |
| `TotalMoney` | `decimal` | Total monetary value of the order |

## Technical Implementation

The `UserCheckedOutIntegrationEvent` is implemented as a simple record in C#:

```csharp frame="terminal"
public sealed record UserCheckedOutIntegrationEvent(
    Guid OrderId,
    Guid BasketId,
    string? Email,
    decimal TotalMoney
) : IntegrationEvent;
```

## Workflow Context

This event plays a pivotal role in the order processing workflow:

1. It is published by the Ordering service when a user completes checkout
2. The Finance service receives this event and initiates the order state machine
3. The event triggers the transition from basket to order in the system
4. It serves as the correlation identifier for the entire order processing saga

## Cross-Service Communication

This event facilitates communication between several bounded contexts:

- **Ordering → Finance**: Initiates the order processing saga
- **Finance → Basket**: Signals that the basket should be marked as processed

## Business Impact

From a business perspective, this event represents a critical moment in the customer journey:

- Conversion of a shopping intent (basket) to a purchase commitment (order)
- Beginning of the fulfillment process
- Opportunity for order confirmation communications
- Point of financial transaction initiation
