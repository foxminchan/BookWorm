## Overview

The `DeleteBasketCompleteCommand` is an integration event published by the Finance service when a basket is successfully deleted during the order processing workflow. This command is part of the normal success flow in the order processing saga and is used to notify other services about the successful basket cleanup, allowing them to proceed with subsequent steps in the order fulfillment process.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## Message Structure

The command contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `OrderId` | `Guid` | Unique identifier for the associated order |
| `TotalMoney` | `decimal` | Total monetary value of the order |

## Workflow Context

This command is published by the Order State Machine when the following conditions are met:

1. The order is in the `Placed` state
2. A `BasketDeletedCompleteIntegrationEvent` is received, indicating successful basket deletion
3. The command is published to notify downstream services about the successful operation

## Technical Implementation

The `DeleteBasketCompleteCommand` is implemented as follows:

```csharp frame="terminal"
[AsyncApi]
[Channel("basket-checkout-complete")]
[SubscribeOperation(
    typeof(DeleteBasketCompleteCommand),
    OperationId = nameof(DeleteBasketCompleteCommand),
    Summary = "Delete basket complete"
)]
public sealed record DeleteBasketCompleteCommand(Guid OrderId, decimal TotalMoney)
    : IntegrationEvent;
```

Within the Order State Machine, the command is published when a basket deletion is confirmed:

```csharp frame="terminal"
When(BasketDeleted)
    .Then(context =>
    {
        context.Saga.BasketId = context.Message.BasketId;
        context.Saga.OrderId = context.Message.OrderId;
        context.Saga.TotalMoney = context.Message.TotalMoney;

        logger.LogInformation(
            "[{Event}] Basket deleted for {OrderId}",
            nameof(BasketDeleted),
            context.Message.OrderId
        );
    })
    .Publish(context => new DeleteBasketCompleteCommand(
        context.Saga.OrderId,
        context.Saga.TotalMoney.GetValueOrDefault(0.0M)
    ))
```

## Success Flow

This command plays an important role in the successful order processing flow:

1. When a basket is successfully deleted, the `BasketDeletedCompleteIntegrationEvent` is received
2. The state machine processes this event and publishes the `DeleteBasketCompleteCommand`
3. This command signals to downstream services that the basket has been successfully cleaned up
4. The order processing can continue to the next steps

## Consuming Services

This command is typically consumed by:

- **Ordering Service**: To update the order status and store in event store
- **Notification Service**: To send order confirmation to the customer
