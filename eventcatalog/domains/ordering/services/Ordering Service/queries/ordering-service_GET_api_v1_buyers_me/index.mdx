## Overview

This endpoint retrieves the current buyer's information from the Ordering bounded context. In our domain model, a Buyer represents a customer entity with purchasing capabilities and order history.

### Domain Significance

Within the Ordering domain, the Buyer aggregate is responsible for:

- Maintaining buyer identity and preferences
- Tracking order history and purchasing patterns
- Managing payment methods and shipping addresses

### Implementation Details

This endpoint follows the CQRS pattern using a dedicated query handler that:

1. Authenticates the current user
2. Retrieves the corresponding Buyer aggregate from the repository
3. Returns a read-model projection of the buyer data

### Administrative Access

Administrators can access specific buyer information by providing an optional query parameter:

- `?id={buyerId}`: Retrieve a specific buyer by their unique identifier (admin only)

When accessed by regular users, the endpoint always returns the buyer information associated with the authenticated user's identity.
