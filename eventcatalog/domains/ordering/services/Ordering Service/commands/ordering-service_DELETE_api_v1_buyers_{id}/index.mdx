## Overview

This endpoint allows for the removal of a Buyer aggregate from the system. In the Ordering domain, a Buyer represents a customer who has placed one or more orders. This operation is restricted to administrators only.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

### Domain Significance

Within the bounded context of the Ordering domain, the Buyer aggregate root contains important customer information related to ordering, including:

- Address information
- Order history references
- Payment methods

### Command Handling

When this endpoint is called:

1. A `DeleteBuyerCommand` is dispatched via the CQRS pattern with the Buyer ID
2. The command handler retrieves the Buyer aggregate from the repository
3. If the Buyer is not found, a `NotFoundException` is thrown
4. If found, the Buyer is marked for deletion in the repository
5. Changes are persisted through the Unit of Work pattern

### Security Considerations

This endpoint is protected by the Admin authorization policy, ensuring that only administrators can delete buyer records. This is implemented through the `.RequireAuthorization(Authorization.Policies.Admin)` middleware.

### Consistency Considerations

This operation maintains aggregate consistency through the Unit of Work pattern, ensuring that all changes are committed atomically. The operation either succeeds completely or fails without partial updates.

### Error Handling

- If the buyer with the specified ID does not exist, a 404 Not Found response is returned
- Authorization failures result in a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response
- Other exceptions are handled by the global exception handler

## DELETE `(/api/v1/buyers/{id})`

### Parameters

- **id** (path) (required): The buyer's unique identifier (GUID format)

### Example Usage

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/buyers/{id}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```
