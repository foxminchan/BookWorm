## Overview

Create a new buyer in the Ordering bounded context. The Buyer represents a crucial aggregate root in the Ordering domain model that encapsulates customer purchasing identity and payment methods.

## Domain Significance

In our domain model, a Buyer:

- Serves as an aggregate root with its own identity
- Maintains a collection of payment methods
- Associates with orders while preserving customer information
- Enforces invariants around required buyer information and valid payment methods

This endpoint allows clients to register a new Buyer entity in the system, which is a prerequisite for creating orders. The creation process validates that all required buyer attributes meet domain rules and generates a unique identifier for the new aggregate.

## Business Rules

- Each Buyer must have a unique identifier
- A Buyer must be associated with a valid user identity
- Payment methods added to a Buyer must contain valid payment information
- Buyer information is independently maintained from the customer profile in other bounded contexts
