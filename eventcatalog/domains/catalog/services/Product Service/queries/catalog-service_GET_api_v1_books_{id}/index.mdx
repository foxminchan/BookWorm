## Overview

This endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a specific Book aggregate root from the Catalog bounded context by its unique identifier. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entity to a BookDto response through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.

If the requested book doesn't exist, the service returns a Not Found response rather than a null object, following the Fail Fast principle.

This endpoint is also integrated with our distributed caching strategy to optimize read-heavy operations and reduce database load.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## Behavior

The endpoint implements the following behavior:

1. Validates the provided GUID format for the book ID
2. Queries the book repository to fetch the book entity
3. If the book is not found, returns a 404 Not Found response
4. Maps the domain entity to a DTO using the configured auto-mapper
5. Returns the book data with a 200 OK status code

## Implementation Details

The endpoint is implemented using:

- CQRS pattern with a dedicated query handler
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Repository pattern for data access
- Auto-mapping for entity-to-DTO conversion
- Proper error handling with domain-specific exceptions
