## Overview

The DELETE operation removes a book entity from the catalog domain if it exists. This endpoint enforces proper domain boundaries by validating the book's existence and ensuring there are no constraint violations before deletion.

The operation is idempotent - multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request, aligning with REST architectural constraints.

**Authorization**: Requires "ADMIN" role to maintain aggregate integrity.

**Domain Validation**:

- Validates book exists before deletion
- Checks for business rules that might prevent deletion (e.g., books with active orders)
