## Overview

This endpoint implements the command part of CQRS pattern to create a new Author entity in the Catalog bounded context. It follows Domain-Driven Design principles by encapsulating the author creation operation as a discrete business capability.

Authorization is enforced through policy-based permissions, ensuring only authenticated users with appropriate roles can create authors in the system.

Performance considerations:

- Author creation is idempotent
- Validation occurs before persistence
- Transactional boundaries are respected
