## Overview

Update an existing author in the catalog domain. This endpoint adheres to Domain-Driven Design principles by:

- Enforcing domain rules and invariants during update operations
- Validating author data against the bounded context constraints
- Generating domain events upon successful updates
- Maintaining aggregate consistency

The operation is idempotent and will return appropriate error responses if the author ID does not exist or if business rules are violated. Updates will be propagated through domain events to maintain consistency across the system.

## Security

- Requires administrative privileges (Admin policy)
- Authentication is required

## Technical Details

### Validation Rules

- Author ID must be a valid GUID and cannot be empty
- Author name is required
- Author name must not exceed the large data schema length

### Implementation Notes

- Uses CQRS pattern with Mediator implementation
- Performs optimistic concurrency control through unit of work
- Implements proper domain event handling
- Returns 204 No Content on successful update

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## PUT `(/api/v1/authors/{id})`
