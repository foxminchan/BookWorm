## Overview

The Ordering Service is a core bounded context in the BookWorm ecosystem responsible for managing the complete order lifecycle. Implemented using Domain-Driven Design principles, this service encapsulates all business logic related to order processing, from creation to fulfillment or cancellation.

### Domain Model

The service is structured around the Order aggregate root, which enforces invariants and business rules across the entire ordering process. Key components include:

- **Order Aggregate**: Central entity that maintains order consistency and contains:

  - Order Items (entities)
  - Order Status (enumeration value object)

- **Buyer Aggregate**: Represents customer information with:
  - Personal Details (entity)
  - Default Address (value object)

### Patterns & Implementation

- **CQRS Pattern**: Separates command and query responsibilities
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides persistence abstraction for aggregates
- **Specification Pattern**: Encapsulates business rules for order validation
- **State Pattern**: Manages transitions between order statuses

### External Dependencies

The Ordering Service interacts with:

- **Basket Service**: Consumes basket data for order creation
- **Catalog Service**: Validates product availability
- **Notification Service**: Triggers customer notifications on status changes
