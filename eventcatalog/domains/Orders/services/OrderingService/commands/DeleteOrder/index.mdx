## Overview

This endpoint allows administrators to delete an order from the system. In alignment with Domain-Driven Design principles, order deletion is handled as a domain operation that respects the Order aggregate boundary and implements a soft-delete pattern.

### Domain Considerations

- **Soft Delete Pattern**: The Order entity implements the `ISoftDelete` interface, setting a flag rather than physically removing records
- **Aggregate Consistency**: The deletion operation ensures the entire Order aggregate maintains its consistency through the Unit of Work pattern
- **Domain Events**: The operation may trigger domain events for cross-service communication

### Implementation Details

When an order is deleted:

1. The command handler retrieves the Order aggregate by ID
2. If the order doesn't exist, a `NotFoundException` is thrown
3. The `Delete()` method on the Order entity sets the `IsDeleted` flag to true
4. Changes are persisted through the Unit of Work pattern

### Security Considerations

This endpoint is protected by the Admin authorization policy, ensuring that only administrators can delete orders. This is implemented through the `.RequireAuthorization(Authorization.Policies.Admin)` middleware.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## DELETE `(/api/v1/orders/{id})`

### Parameters

- **id** (path) (required): The order's unique identifier (GUID format)

### Example Usage

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/orders/{id}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```
