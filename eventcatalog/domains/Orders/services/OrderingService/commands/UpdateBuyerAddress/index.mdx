## Overview

This endpoint allows authenticated users to update their address information within the Ordering bounded context. In DDD terms, the Buyer is an aggregate root within the Ordering domain that contains Address as a value object.

The operation respects the invariants of the Buyer aggregate by ensuring that address changes are validated and consistently applied. Address updates are significant domain events as they can affect shipping options, tax calculations, and order fulfillment processes.

## Implementation Details

When a buyer's address is updated:

1. The system retrieves the buyer ID from the authenticated user's claims
2. The buyer entity is fetched from the repository
3. If the buyer doesn't exist, a `NotFoundException` is thrown
4. The `UpdateAddress` method on the Buyer entity is called with the new address details
5. Changes are persisted through the Unit of Work pattern

## Validation Rules

- Street is required (maximum length: 50 characters)
- City is required (maximum length: 50 characters)
- Province is required (maximum length: 50 characters)
