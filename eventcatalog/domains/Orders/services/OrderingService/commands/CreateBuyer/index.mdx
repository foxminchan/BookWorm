## Overview

Create a new buyer in the Ordering bounded context. The Buyer represents a crucial aggregate root in the Ordering domain model that encapsulates customer purchasing identity and address information. This endpoint requires authentication, as the buyer is created based on the authenticated user's identity.

## Implementation Details

The Create Buyer operation is implemented using the CQRS pattern with a command handler:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant CreateBuyerEndpoint
    participant CreateBuyerCommand
    participant BuyerRepository
    participant Buyer

    Client->>CreateBuyerEndpoint: POST /api/v1/buyers
    CreateBuyerEndpoint->>CreateBuyerCommand: Send(command)
    CreateBuyerCommand->>CreateBuyerCommand: Extract user ID from claims
    CreateBuyerCommand->>CreateBuyerCommand: Extract user name from claims
    CreateBuyerCommand->>Buyer: new Buyer(userId, name, street, city, province)
    Buyer->>Buyer: Create Address value object
    CreateBuyerCommand->>BuyerRepository: AddAsync(buyer)
    CreateBuyerCommand->>BuyerRepository: SaveEntitiesAsync()
    CreateBuyerCommand-->>CreateBuyerEndpoint: Buyer ID
    CreateBuyerEndpoint-->>Client: 201 Created with Buyer ID
```

### Key Components

1. **CreateBuyerCommand**: Implements `ICommand<Guid>` to create a new buyer and return its ID
2. **Address Value Object**: Encapsulates the buyer's address information (street, city, province)
3. **Buyer Aggregate**: The root entity that maintains the buyer's identity and address
4. **Claims Extraction**: The user's ID and name are extracted from the authentication claims

## Business Rules

- The buyer ID is automatically derived from the authenticated user's identity
- The buyer name is extracted from the authenticated user's claims
- Address information (street, city, province) is required and validated
- Each field has a maximum length constraint (defined in DataSchemaLength.Medium)
- The buyer is created with an empty collection of orders

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## POST `(/api/v1/buyers)`

### Request

<SchemaViewer file="request-body.json" maxHeight="500" id="request-body" />
