## Overview

This event represents an integration event when an order status is changed to cancel. The `OrderStatusChangedToCancelIntegrationEvent` is a domain event that captures the change of an order's status to cancel in the Ordering bounded context. It carries the necessary value objects including the order identity, the new status, and the cancellation reason to notify the system about the status change. This event adheres to the ubiquitous language of our domain and serves as the contract between the Ordering and external systems, facilitating the transition from a pending order to a cancelled one.

## Workflow Context

1. It is published by the Ordering service when an order is cancelled
2. The Finance service receives this event and updates the order state machine
3. The event triggers the transition to the Cancelled state in the Finance service
4. It may initiate compensating transactions or recovery actions

## Cross-Service Communication

- **Ordering → Finance**: Notifies about order cancellation
- **Finance → Notification**: May trigger cancellation notifications to customers

## Business Impact

From a business perspective, this event represents several important aspects:

- Customer decision to cancel an order
- Opportunity to gather cancellation reasons for business intelligence
- Trigger for potential customer retention actions
