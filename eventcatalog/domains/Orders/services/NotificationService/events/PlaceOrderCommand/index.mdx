## Overview

The `PlaceOrderCommand` is a critical domain command that initiates the order creation process in the BookWorm e-commerce system. This command serves as the bridge between the Basket and Ordering bounded contexts, facilitating the transition from a transient shopping basket to a persistent order.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

### Purpose
- Initiates the order creation process
- Transfers basket data to the ordering system
- Triggers the deletion of the original basket
- Ensures atomic transaction between basket deletion and order creation

### Command Structure

```json title="Event Message"
{
  "basketId": "Guid",
  "email": "string?",
  "orderId": "Guid",
  "totalMoney": "decimal"
}
```

### Behavior
When this command is processed:
1. The system attempts to delete the specified basket
2. Upon successful deletion, a `BasketDeletedCompleteIntegrationEvent` is published
3. If deletion fails, a `BasketDeletedFailedIntegrationEvent` is published
4. The command handler ensures concurrent message processing is limited to 1 message at a time

### Integration Points
- **Channel**: `basket-place-order`
- **Concurrency**: Limited to 1 concurrent message
- **Related Events**:
  - `BasketDeletedCompleteIntegrationEvent`
  - `BasketDeletedFailedIntegrationEvent`

### Usage Context
This command is typically triggered when:
- A customer completes their shopping cart
- The checkout process is initiated
- The system needs to transition from basket to order state

### Error Handling
The command includes built-in error handling:
- Tracks failed basket deletions
- Maintains order creation state
- Provides feedback through integration events
