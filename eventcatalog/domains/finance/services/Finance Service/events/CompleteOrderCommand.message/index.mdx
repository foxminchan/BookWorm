## Overview

This message represents a command to complete an order in the system. The `CompleteOrderCommand` is a domain event that captures the request to complete an order in the Finance bounded context. It carries the necessary value objects including the order identity, the completion reason, and the total amount to notify the system about the completion operation. This message adheres to the ubiquitous language of our domain and serves as the contract between the Finance and external systems, facilitating the transition from an order to a completed one.
