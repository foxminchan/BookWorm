## Overview

This event represents an integration event when an order status is changed to complete. The `OrderStatusChangedToCompleteIntegrationEvent` is a domain event that captures the change of an order's status to complete in the Ordering bounded context. It carries the necessary value objects including the order identity, the new status, and the completion reason to notify the system about the status change. This event adheres to the ubiquitous language of our domain and serves as the contract between the Ordering and external systems, facilitating the transition from a pending order to a completed one.

## Architecture

## Event Structure

The event contains the following key properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `OrderId` | `Guid` | Unique identifier for the order being completed |
| `BasketId` | `Guid` | Identifier of the basket associated with the order |
| `Email` | `string?` | Customer's email address (optional) for notifications |
| `TotalMoney` | `decimal` | Total monetary value of the completed order |

## Technical Implementation

The `OrderStatusChangedToCompleteIntegrationEvent` is implemented as a simple record in C#:

```csharp frame="terminal"
public sealed record OrderStatusChangedToCompleteIntegrationEvent(
    Guid OrderId,
    Guid BasketId,
    string? Email,
    decimal TotalMoney
) : IntegrationEvent;
```

## Workflow Context

This event plays an important role in the order completion workflow:

1. It is published by the Ordering service when an order is successfully completed
2. The Finance service receives this event and updates the order state machine
3. The event triggers the transition to the Completed state in the Finance service
4. It may initiate follow-up processes like customer notifications or analytics updates

## Cross-Service Communication

This event facilitates communication between several bounded contexts:

- **Ordering → Finance**: Notifies about order completion
- **Finance → Notification**: May trigger completion notifications to customers

## Business Impact

From a business perspective, this event represents several important aspects:

- Successful completion of the order fulfillment process
- Opportunity to gather customer satisfaction metrics
- Trigger for post-purchase marketing activities
- Signal for financial reconciliation and reporting
