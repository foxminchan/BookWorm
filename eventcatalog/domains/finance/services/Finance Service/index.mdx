## Overview

The Finance service acts as a critical orchestration component within the BookWorm ecosystem, implementing Domain-Driven Design principles to manage financial transactions and state transitions across the order fulfillment process.

### Integration Patterns

The Finance service implements a sophisticated event-driven architecture using MassTransit for message-based communication:

- **Event Sourcing**: Captures all state changes as a sequence of events
- **Saga Pattern**: Orchestrates long-running business processes across multiple services
- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures reliable message delivery with transactional outbox
- **Correlation**: Links related events using correlation IDs (OrderId)

### Technical Implementation

The service is built with modern .NET technologies and patterns:

- **MassTransit State Machine**: Implements a robust saga pattern for order processing workflow
- **Entity Framework Core**: Persists saga state and implements outbox pattern
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores saga state, inbox/outbox messages
- **Minimal API**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for querying order state
- **AsyncAPI**: Documents event-driven messaging contracts

## State Machine Workflow

The Finance service implements a state machine with the following states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Placed** | Initial state when an order is placed via `UserCheckedOutIntegrationEvent` |
| **Completed** | Final state for successfully processed orders |
| **Cancelled** | State for orders that have been cancelled |
| **Failed** | State for orders that encountered errors during processing |

### State Transitions

The state machine handles the following transitions:

1. **Initially → Placed**: When `OrderPlaced` event is received
   - Publishes `PlaceOrderCommand`
   
2. **Placed → Failed**: When `BasketDeletedFailed` event is received
   - Publishes `DeleteBasketFailedCommand`
   
3. **Placed → Completed**: When `OrderCompleted` event is received
   - Publishes `CompleteOrderCommand` (if email is available)
   
4. **Placed → Cancelled**: When `OrderCancelled` event is received
   - Publishes `CancelOrderCommand` (if email is available)

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Order Processing** | Orchestrates the financial aspects of order processing, including payment authorization, capture, and settlement |
| **Basket Cleanup** | Manages the deletion of baskets after order placement, with failure handling |
| **Order State Tracking** | Maintains the state of orders throughout their lifecycle |
| **Event-Driven Communication** | Publishes and subscribes to events for asynchronous processing |
| **State Querying** | Provides API endpoints to retrieve current order state |

## Infrastructure

The Finance service is deployed on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure Database for PostgreSQL as the primary data store.

    service server(logos:docker-icon)[Server] in api

```

## Technical Stack

- **MassTransit**: Distributed application framework for message-based communication
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistence
- **MediatR**: In-process messaging with CQRS pattern
- **Aspire**: Cloud-native application platform
- **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI**: API documentation
