## Overview

The `PublishCompletedEvent` is an integration event that signals the successful completion of a reverse basket operation in the system. This event serves as a confirmation mechanism between the Basket and Ordering contexts, indicating that a basket has been successfully deleted and the associated order has been processed. It carries essential information about the completed operation, including the order and basket identifiers.

## Purpose

This event serves several important purposes:
- Confirms successful basket deletion operations
- Maintains system consistency between Basket and Ordering contexts
- Provides audit trail for completed operations
- Facilitates proper state management in the system

## Event Structure

The event contains the following key information:
- `OrderId`: Unique identifier for the associated order
- `BasketId`: Identifier of the successfully deleted basket
- `TotalMoney`: Total monetary value of the basket at the time of deletion

## Usage

This event is typically published when:
- A basket deletion operation completes successfully
- The system needs to confirm the transition from basket to order
- Audit trails need to be maintained

## Success Handling

1. Log the successful completion
2. Update relevant system states
3. Trigger any necessary follow-up processes
4. Maintain audit records
