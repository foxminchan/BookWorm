## Overview

The `BasketDeletedIntegrationEvent` is an integration event that signals the failure of a reverse basket operation in the system. This event plays a crucial role in the error handling and recovery mechanisms between the Basket and Ordering contexts. It carries essential information about the failed operation, including the reverse basket identity, customer identity, and basket item collection.

## Purpose

This event serves several important purposes:
- Notifies the system about failed basket deletion attempts
- Provides necessary data for error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Maintains consistency between the Basket and Ordering contexts
- Facilitates proper error handling and logging

## Event Structure

The event contains the following key information:
- `OrderId`: Unique identifier for the associated order
- `BasketId`: Identifier of the basket that failed to delete
- `Email`: Customer's email address (optional)
- `TotalMoney`: Total monetary value of the basket

## Usage

This event is typically published when:
- A basket deletion operation fails due to system errors
- There are issues with the integration between Basket and Ordering contexts
- Recovery mechanisms need to be triggered
