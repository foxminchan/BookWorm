## Overview

This endpoint allows you to delete a shopping basket by its unique identifier. This operation is an essential part of the Basket domain's lifecycle management.

### Business Rules

- Basket must exist to be deleted
- Only the authenticated owner of the basket can delete their own basket
- Deleting a basket will permanently remove all items within it
- The basket ID is automatically derived from the authenticated user's ID

### Authentication

This endpoint requires authentication. The user's identity is verified using Keycloak authentication:
- A valid authentication token must be provided
- The user's ID is extracted from the `sub` claim in the JWT token
- Unauthorized access will result in a 401 Unauthorized response

### Implementation Details

The delete operation is handled by the `DeleteBasketCommandHandler` which:
- Validates user authentication
- Verifies basket ownership
- Removes the basket from the repository
- Uses the user's ID from claims as the basket identifier
