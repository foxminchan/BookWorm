## Overview

This endpoint creates a new shopping basket for a user. In our domain model, a `Basket` represents an Aggregate Root in the Basket bounded context. Each Basket maintains its own identity and encapsulates a collection of `BasketItem` entities, which are part of the Basket's aggregate boundary.

The `Basket` enforces invariants across its contained items and manages the lifecycle of the `BasketItem` entities through well-defined domain operations. When a basket is created, it establishes the consistency boundary for transactional operations related to the user's shopping experience.

Each `BasketItem` captures the user's intent to purchase a specific book, maintaining quantity and price information while preserving the connection to the Catalog domain through book identifiers.
