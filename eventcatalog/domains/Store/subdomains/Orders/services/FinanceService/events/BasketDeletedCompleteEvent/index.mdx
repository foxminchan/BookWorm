## Overview

The `PublishCompletedEvent` is an integration event that signals the successful completion of a reverse basket operation in the system. This event serves as a confirmation mechanism between the Basket and Ordering contexts, indicating that a basket has been successfully deleted and the associated order has been processed. It carries essential information about the completed operation, including the order and basket identifiers.
