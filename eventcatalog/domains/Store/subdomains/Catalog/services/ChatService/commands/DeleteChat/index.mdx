## Overview

The Delete Chat endpoint allows users to permanently remove a chat session from the BookWorm platform. This endpoint accepts a chat's unique identifier (GUID) and deletes the associated chat session if it exists. It is designed to provide users with the ability to manage their chat history effectively.

The endpoint follows RESTful principles and returns a 204 No Content response upon successful deletion, indicating that the request was processed successfully but no content needs to be returned.
