**Decision tree:**

1. Is this about **AppHost code or deployment definition**? → `aspire-deployment` skill.
2. Is the app **running locally** via `aspire start`? → Aspire CLI.
3. Is it deployed to **AKS**? → kubectl + Container Insights for workload; `azure-diagnostics` for the cluster's Azure resources.
4. Is it deployed to **other Azure** (App Service, Container Apps)? → `azure-diagnostics`.
5. Is it deployed to **Docker / Compose**? → `docker` / `docker compose` CLI.

See [diagnostics-bridge.md](references/diagnostics-bridge.md) for detailed routing.

## Investigation Workflow

When something is wrong, investigate before editing code:

1. `aspire describe` — check resource state and endpoints
2. `aspire otel logs <resource>` — structured logs first
3. `aspire logs <resource>` — console output as secondary view
4. `aspire otel traces <resource>` — cross-service activity
5. `aspire export` — zipped telemetry snapshot for deeper analysis

### Hidden resources are filtered by default

`aspire describe` and other CLI commands filter out resources marked hidden in the AppHost (proxies, helper containers, migrations). The default output is correct for normal app inspection. Add `--include-hidden` when:

- Debugging proxies, sidecar/helper containers, or migration jobs.
- An expected resource is "missing" from `aspire resources` / `aspire describe`.
- Triaging connectivity or wiring issues that may involve infrastructure resources.

### Tips for Agents

```bash
# ✅ Use --format Json for machine parsing (supported: describe, start)
aspire describe --format Json

# ✅ When a resource you expect is missing, retry with --include-hidden
aspire describe --include-hidden --format Json

# ✅ Get endpoints from describe, not guessing ports
ENDPOINT=$(aspire describe apiservice --format Json | jq -r '.endpoints[0].url')

# ✅ Use --apphost <path> when multiple AppHosts exist
aspire describe --apphost ./src/MyApp.AppHost/
```

## Version-Specific Diagnostics

Check the running dashboard version and actual error before applying a historical fix.
An older fix does not establish that downgrading a newer dashboard is a working
mitigation, even temporarily or in an isolated test.

| Symptom                                                     | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Resource missing from `aspire describe`                     | Re-run `aspire describe --include-hidden`; do not use removed `aspire ps --include-hidden`.                                                                                           |
| DevTunnel is healthy but has no public URL on 13.5.0-13.5.2 | Fixed in 13.5.3. Use a compatible release containing the fix before changing endpoint configuration.                                                                                  |
| Known multi-path icon Graph crash on 13.5.0-13.5.2          | Fixed in 13.5.3. Use a compatible release containing the fix.                                                                                                                         |
| Dashboard Graph crashes on 13.5.3 or later                  | Keep the selected version. Capture the browser console stack trace and dashboard logs to diagnose a separate cause or regression; do not recommend installing 13.5.3 as a workaround. |

> **Resolved in 13.3**: The standalone-dashboard workaround for [#16236](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/16236) is obsolete — use `aspire dashboard run` (see below).

## Standalone Dashboard (`aspire dashboard run`)

`aspire dashboard run` launches the Aspire Dashboard without an AppHost, so any OTLP-emitting application (Aspire or not) can stream telemetry into it.

```bash
aspire dashboard run
# Dashboard:  http://localhost:18888/login?t=<TOKEN>
# OTLP/gRPC:  http://localhost:4317
# OTLP/HTTP:  http://localhost:4318
```

> ⚠️ **Foreground / blocking.** `aspire dashboard run` does **not** return until you stop it (Ctrl-C). Agents must treat it as a long-running background process — start it with the bash tool's `mode="async"`, capture the dashboard URL and token from initial output, and leave it running. Do **not** invoke it as a one-shot synchronous command, and do **not** wait for it to "finish".

### Connect the Aspire CLI to a standalone dashboard

`aspire otel logs` and `aspire otel traces` accept `--dashboard-url`. The simplest form passes the full login URL printed by `aspire dashboard run` — the CLI normalizes it automatically:

```bash
# Stream structured logs from a standalone dashboard (login URL form)
aspire otel logs --dashboard-url "http://localhost:18888/login?t=TOKEN" --follow

# Search recent traces
aspire otel traces --dashboard-url "http://localhost:18888/login?t=TOKEN"
```

For dashboards configured with API-key authentication (e.g., the standalone container image with a separate API key), pass `--api-key` alongside the base `--dashboard-url`:

```bash
aspire otel logs --dashboard-url https://my-dashboard.example.com --api-key "$DASHBOARD_API_KEY" --follow
```

The container-image standalone dashboard still works for environments where the CLI isn't available.

## Browser Logs (`Aspire.Hosting.Browsers`)

When a frontend has already opted into `WithBrowserLogs()`, Aspire creates a child resource named
`<frontend>-browser-logs`. Browser console messages, errors, exceptions, and network diagnostics
are sent to that child resource's console log stream, not to the frontend's OpenTelemetry logs.

1. Begin with normal `aspire describe` or `aspire resources` output to find
   `<frontend>-browser-logs`; `aspire ps` no longer lists resources. It is a normal child
   resource, so retry with `aspire describe --include-hidden` only if unavailable.
2. Correlate it to the frontend through its parent relationship and `Source` property.
3. Start a tracked browser session with:

   ```bash
   aspire resource <frontend>-browser-logs open-tracked-browser
   ```

4. Inspect the browser diagnostics with:

   ```bash
   aspire logs <frontend>-browser-logs
   ```

Do **not** use `aspire otel logs <frontend>` for browser output; it does not return that child
resource's browser diagnostics.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inspect existing browser diagnostics               | Discover `<frontend>-browser-logs`, start `open-tracked-browser`, then run `aspire logs <frontend>-browser-logs` |
| Confirm the browser resource belongs to a frontend | Check the child resource's parent relationship and `Source` property                                             |
| Confirm a frontend has browser logging enabled     | Check the AppHost for `.WithBrowserLogs()` on the resource                                                       |
| Add `WithBrowserLogs()` to a resource              | → **`aspireify` skill** (AppHost authoring) — do not edit the AppHost from this skill                            |

## Dashboard UX Features

Agents inspecting a running dashboard should know:

- **Notification center** (bell icon, top-right) — surfaces results of resource commands and lifecycle events. Inline command responses appear here instead of being scraped from the logs panel.
- **Rebuild command** — available on container and project resources; rebuilds the image and restarts the resource without restarting the whole AppHost. Result lands in the notification center.
- **Structured command results** — custom resource commands return `ExecuteCommandResult` with a `Message` payload that the dashboard renders inline; HTTP commands set `HttpCommandResultMode.Auto | Json | Text | None` to control how the response body is shown.
- **13.5 filtering** — filter telemetry by timestamp, use `==` / `!=` for exact numeric
  values, and search console-log text while streams continue updating.
- **Terminal view** — resources configured with experimental `WithTerminal()` open as
  interactive sessions in the dashboard.
- **No dashboard AI Assistant** — it was removed in 13.5. Use `aspire agent init` and the
  AppHost/CLI agent integration instead.
- **VS Code launch is opt-in** — the Aspire extension no longer opens the dashboard
  automatically. Use its in-editor dashboard or configure `dashboardBrowser` /
  `launch.json`.

> Authoring custom commands or `WithBrowserLogs()` calls is AppHost work — route to **`aspireify`**. This skill is for _observing_ what those features surface in the dashboard.

## Why Aspire CLI Can't Do Remote Diagnostics

The Aspire CLI talks to a _running AppHost_ through a local backchannel socket at `~/.aspire/backchannels/`. This is **by design** — there is no remote backchannel. For deployed apps, route to platform-specific tools (azure-diagnostics, kubectl, docker).

**Exception**: if a Dashboard is reachable (deployed alongside the app, or running standalone), `aspire otel logs` and `aspire otel traces` can query it via `--dashboard-url` (login URL form) and optional `--api-key` (see the Standalone Dashboard section above). This does **not** apply to `aspire logs` or `aspire describe`.
