# Stakeholders

## Overview

Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

| Role/Name                               | Contact        | Expectations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FullStack Developer & Project Owner** | Solo Developer | Comprehensive architecture documentation for future reference and maintenance. Clear technical decisions rationale for long-term project sustainability. Scalable design patterns for potential team expansion. Self-contained documentation for knowledge preservation. |

## Additional Stakeholders

While the BookWorm project is currently a solo development effort, the following external stakeholders still influence architectural decisions:

| Role/Name                  | Contact              | Expectations                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **End Users (Customers)**  | Future Users         | Intuitive user experience and reliable performance. Fast response times and seamless book browsing/purchasing. Mobile-friendly responsive design. Secure payment processing.   |
| **Cloud Platform (Azure)** | Microsoft Azure      | Compliance with Azure best practices. Efficient resource utilization. Proper use of Azure services and pricing models. Security and compliance standards adherence.            |
| **Payment Providers**      | Stripe, PayPal, etc. | PCI DSS compliance for payment processing. Proper API integration and error handling. Secure data transmission and storage. Transaction monitoring and fraud prevention.       |
| **Third-party APIs**       | Book Data Providers  | Efficient API usage within rate limits. Proper caching strategies to minimize API calls. Graceful handling of API failures and timeouts. Data synchronization and consistency. |
| **Open Source Community**  | GitHub Contributors  | Clean, maintainable code for potential contributions. Comprehensive README and contribution guidelines. Proper licensing and attribution. Security vulnerability reporting.    |

## Solo Developer Responsibilities

As the sole team member, the developer assumes multiple roles and responsibilities:

### **Technical Roles**

- **Solution Architect**: Design system architecture and make technology decisions
- **Frontend Developer**: Implement user interface and user experience
- **Backend Developer**: Build APIs, business logic, and data management
- **DevOps Engineer**: Set up CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring
- **QA Engineer**: Write tests, perform quality assurance, and bug fixing
- **Database Administrator**: Design data models and optimize performance

### **Business Roles**

- **Product Owner**: Define features, priorities, and business requirements
- **Project Manager**: Plan timeline, manage scope, and track progress
- **Business Analyst**: Research market needs and competitive analysis

## Self-Documentation Strategy

Since this is a solo project, documentation serves as future self-reference:

### **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

- **Purpose**: Record reasoning behind major architectural decisions
- **Audience**: Future self and potential collaborators
- **Format**: Structured decision documentation with context and consequences

### **Technical Documentation**

- **Purpose**: Maintain comprehensive system knowledge
- **Audience**: Future maintenance and development
- **Format**: Living documentation in repository with code examples

### **Project Journal**

- **Purpose**: Track development progress and lessons learned
- **Audience**: Personal reference and retrospectives
- **Format**: Regular updates on challenges, solutions, and improvements

### **Knowledge Preservation**

- **Purpose**: Ensure project continuity and knowledge transfer
- **Audience**: Future team members or project handover
- **Format**: Comprehensive guides and architectural overviews

## Solo Developer Impact Analysis

### **High Priority Considerations**

- **Self-Documentation**: Critical for future maintenance and development continuity
- **End Users**: Ultimate success criteria for the application
- **External Services**: Direct dependencies that impact system functionality

### **Medium Priority Considerations**

- **Cloud Platform**: Infrastructure efficiency and cost management
- **Open Source Community**: Potential for collaboration and code sharing

### **Monitoring Considerations**

- **Payment Providers**: Compliance and integration requirements
- **Third-party APIs**: Service dependencies and rate limiting

## Decision-Making Process

As a solo developer, architectural decisions are streamlined but require careful consideration:

### **Self-Review Process**

1. **Research Phase**: Evaluate multiple technical options
2. **Documentation**: Record decision rationale in ADRs
3. **Implementation**: Build with future scalability in mind
4. **Validation**: Test assumptions and gather user feedback
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on real-world usage

### **External Validation**

- **Community Feedback**: Leverage open source community for code reviews
- **User Testing**: Gather feedback from beta users and stakeholders
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards and Azure recommendations
