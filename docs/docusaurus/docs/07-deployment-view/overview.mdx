# Deployment View Overview

The BookWorm application is built using .NET Aspire, a cloud-native application framework that orchestrates containerized services. The deployment architecture supports both local development and cloud production environments with Azure Container Apps.

## Application Host

The `BookWorm.AppHost` project serves as the orchestration layer, defining the entire application topology including:

- **8 Microservices**: Catalog, Chat, Basket, Notification, Ordering, Rating, Finance, and Scheduler
- **Infrastructure Components**: PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Qdrant Vector DB, Azure Storage
- **Identity Provider**: Keycloak with custom theming
- **AI Integration**: Ollama with Gemma 3 and Nomic Embed Text models
- **API Gateway**: YARP-based reverse proxy
- **Monitoring**: Health Checks UI, Scalar API documentation, K6 performance testing

## Execution Contexts

The application supports two primary execution contexts:

### Development Mode (`IsRunMode`)
- Local container orchestration using Docker
- Single replica deployment for services
- Emulated Azure services (Storage, SignalR, PostgreSQL)
- K6 performance testing enabled
- Scalar API documentation available

### Production Mode (`IsPublishMode`)
- Azure Container Apps deployment
- Multi-replica service deployment (2+ replicas)
- Native Azure services integration
- CORS configuration for production domains
- Optimized AI models (Gemma 3 4B instead of 1B)

## Key Features

- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service resolution using Aspire service discovery
- **Configuration Management**: Parameterized deployment with secure secrets
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all services and dependencies
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and metrics
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with Keycloak, RBAC for Azure resources
