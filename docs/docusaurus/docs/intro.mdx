# Architecture Documentation with arc42

Welcome to **BookWorm's architecture documentation** using the arc42 template.

## What is arc42?

arc42 is a proven template for software architecture documentation. It provides a standardized structure that helps architects and developers communicate complex systems effectively.

### Key Benefits

- **Systematic approach** to documenting software architecture
- **Stakeholder-oriented** structure covering all relevant aspects
- **Technology-agnostic** and can be used for any type of system
- **Iterative and incremental** documentation process

## Core Sections

The arc42 template consists of 12 main sections:

1. **Introduction and Goals** - What does the system achieve?
2. **Architecture Constraints** - What constraints must be considered?
3. **Context and Scope** - What are the system boundaries?
4. **Solution Strategy** - What is the overall approach?
5. **Building Block View** - How is the system structured?
6. **Runtime View** - How does the system behave at runtime?
7. **Deployment View** - How is the system deployed?
8. **Cross-cutting Concepts** - What are the overarching principles?
9. **Architecture Decisions** - What important decisions were made?
10. **Quality Requirements** - What quality attributes are important?
11. **Risks and Technical Debt** - What are the known issues?
12. **Glossary** - What terms need definition?
