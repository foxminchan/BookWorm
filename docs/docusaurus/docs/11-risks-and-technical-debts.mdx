# Technical Risks and Debts

## Introduction

This section identifies and analyzes technical risks that could impact BookWorm's development, deployment, and operation. It also documents current technical debt and strategies for continuous risk management and debt reduction.

## Technical Risks

### High-Priority Risks

#### RISK-001: External AI Service Dependencies 游댮

- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Probability**: Medium (30-50%)
- **Impact**: High - AI features unavailable, degraded user experience

**Description**: BookWorm relies on external AI services (Nomic Embed Text, Gemma models) for enhanced search and chat functionality. Service outages, API changes, or rate limiting could significantly impact core features.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI service calls
- Develop fallback mechanisms (cached responses, basic text search)
- Create abstraction layer for easy AI provider switching
- Establish SLA monitoring and alerting
- Maintain local cache of common AI responses

**Contingency Plan**:
- Graceful degradation to traditional text search when AI unavailable
- Queue AI requests for processing during outages
- Pre-computed recommendation fallbacks

- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Probability**: High (60-80%)
- **Impact**: Medium - System slowdown, poor user experience

**Description**: As BookWorm scales, PostgreSQL databases may become performance bottlenecks, especially for catalog searches and complex queries with large datasets.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement read replicas for query distribution
- Database connection pooling and query optimization
- Comprehensive Redis caching strategy
- Continuous database performance monitoring
- Plan for database sharding if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Emergency horizontal scaling with read replicas
- Cache warming procedures for critical data

## Technical Debt Inventory

### Current Technical Debt

#### DEBT-001: Missing Integration Tests 游리

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Effort to Fix**: 3-4 weeks
- **Interest Rate**: Low - Gradual increase in debugging time

**Description**: While unit tests provide good coverage, comprehensive integration tests between microservices are missing, making cross-service issue detection difficult.

**Impact**:
- Potential integration bugs in production
- Longer debugging time for cross-service issues
- Reduced deployment confidence

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Define integration test strategy using TestContainers
2. Implement contract testing between services
3. Create end-to-end test scenarios for critical user journeys
4. Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline with quality gates

#### DEBT-002: Advanced Observability Gaps 游리

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Effort to Fix**: 2-3 weeks
- **Interest Rate**: Medium - Increasing troubleshooting complexity

**Description**: Current monitoring setup lacks advanced features like distributed tracing correlation, custom business metrics dashboards, and proactive alerting.

**Impact**:
- Difficult production issue troubleshooting
- Limited system performance visibility
- Reactive rather than proactive monitoring

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Implement comprehensive OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
2. Create custom business metrics dashboards in Azure Monitor
3. Set up proactive alerting rules with escalation procedures
4. Develop runbook procedures for common operational issues

---

#### DEBT-003: Security Hardening Requirements 游댮

- **Severity**: High
- **Effort to Fix**: 4-6 weeks
- **Interest Rate**: High - Security vulnerability exposure

**Description**: Security implementation is functional but lacks advanced features like comprehensive rate limiting, input validation, and detailed audit logging.

**Impact**:
- Vulnerability to various attack vectors (DDoS, injection attacks)
- Compliance gaps with security standards
- Limited forensic capabilities for security incidents

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
2. Add rate limiting and DDoS protection at API gateway level
3. Enhance audit logging with security event correlation
4. Conduct automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
5. Perform regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

#### DEBT-004: Documentation and Runbooks 游리

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Effort to Fix**: 2-3 weeks

**Description**: While API documentation exists, operational runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and deployment procedures need enhancement for production operations.

**Impact**:
- Slower onboarding for new team members
- Increased incident resolution time
- Knowledge silos and single points of expertise

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Create comprehensive operational runbooks for each service
2. Document troubleshooting procedures with decision trees
