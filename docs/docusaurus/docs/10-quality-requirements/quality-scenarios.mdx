### S-3: Storage Scaling

- **Source**: Catalog grows from 100k to 1M books
- **Stimulus**: Large volume of new book data and images
- **Environment**: Production with increasing data storage needs
- **Artifact**: Database and Azure Storage services
- **Response**: Storage automatically scales, indexing performance maintained
- **Response Measure**: Search performance remains < 500ms despite 10x data growth

## Security Scenarios

### SEC-1: Authentication Attack

- **Source**: Malicious user attempting brute force login
- **Stimulus**: Multiple failed authentication attempts from same IP
- **Environment**: Production API gateway and Keycloak
- **Artifact**: Authentication service and rate limiting
- **Response**: Account locked after 5 attempts, IP blocked, security team notified
- **Response Measure**: Attack mitigated within 1 minute, zero unauthorized access

### SEC-2: Data Breach Attempt

- **Source**: Unauthorized attempt to access customer data
- **Stimulus**: SQL injection or API manipulation attempt
- **Environment**: Production database and API services
- **Artifact**: Data access layer and API endpoints
