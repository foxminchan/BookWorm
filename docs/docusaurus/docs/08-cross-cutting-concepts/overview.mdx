# Cross-Cutting Concepts Overview

This section describes the cross-cutting concepts that are implemented across all services in the BookWorm application. These concepts ensure consistency, maintainability, and operational excellence throughout the system.

## Architecture Components

The BookWorm application implements cross-cutting concerns through two main components:

### BookWorm.Chassis
A comprehensive building block library that provides core functionality for all microservices, including:
- **CQRS Pattern Implementation** - Command and Query separation with MediatR
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Integration events with MassTransit and RabbitMQ
- **Database Access** - Repository pattern with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Specifications, guards, and domain abstractions
- **AI Integration** - Agent Framework, Ollama, and RAG capabilities
- **Exception Handling** - Centralized error management and custom exceptions
- **API Endpoints** - Minimal APIs with automatic registration and versioning
- **Data Serialization** - JSON converters and type transformation
- **Guards & Defensive Programming** - Input validation and security guards
- **Repository & Specifications** - Data access abstraction with query composition

### BookWorm.ServiceDefaults
Aspire-based service defaults that standardize common configurations:
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Keycloak integration with JWT tokens
- **Service Discovery** - Aspire service discovery for microservice communication
- **Health Checks** - Comprehensive health monitoring endpoints
- **OpenAPI Documentation** - Automated API specification generation
- **Telemetry** - OpenTelemetry integration for observability
- **Rate Limiting & CORS** - API protection and cross-origin resource sharing
- **HTTP Client Configuration** - Resilient HTTP communication patterns
