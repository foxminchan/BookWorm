# Logging

The BookWorm application implements comprehensive logging using .NET's built-in logging framework enhanced with custom extensions and structured logging capabilities.

## Logging Architecture

### Framework Integration
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** - Core logging abstraction
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Compliance.Redaction** - Sensitive data redaction
- **Custom Logging Extensions** - Enhanced logging capabilities in BookWorm.Chassis

### Key Features

#### Structured Logging
- JSON-formatted log entries for better searchability and parsing
- Consistent log structure across all microservices
- Contextual information including correlation IDs and user context

#### Log Levels
- **Trace** - Detailed execution flow for debugging
- **Debug** - Development-time diagnostic information
- **Information** - General application flow and business events
- **Warning** - Potentially harmful situations that don't stop execution
- **Error** - Error events that allow the application to continue
- **Critical** - Serious errors that may cause application termination

#### Sensitive Data Protection
- Automatic redaction of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Configurable redaction patterns for different data types
- Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Integration with OpenTelemetry

### Trace Correlation
- Automatic correlation between logs and distributed traces
- Span context injection for cross-service request tracking
- Activity-based logging for request lifecycle monitoring

### Log Forwarding
- Integration with OpenTelemetry logging pipeline
- Export to external systems (Grafana, Elastic Stack, Azure Monitor)
- Centralized log aggregation for distributed system monitoring

## Best Practices

### Logging Guidelines
- Use structured logging with consistent property names
- Avoid logging sensitive information in production
- Include relevant context (user ID, correlation ID, operation)
- Use appropriate log levels based on event severity
- Implement log sampling for high-volume scenarios

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous logging to prevent blocking operations
- Log level filtering based on environment configuration
- Efficient serialization of log objects
- Batching and buffering for high-throughput scenarios
