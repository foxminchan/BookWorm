# Rate Limiting & CORS

The BookWorm application implements comprehensive rate limiting and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to protect APIs from abuse, ensure fair resource usage, and enable secure cross-origin requests.

## Rate Limiting

### Rate Limiting Architecture
- **Built-in ASP.NET Core Rate Limiting** - Native framework rate limiting support
- **Policy-Based Configuration** - Flexible rate limiting policies for different scenarios
- **Client Identification** - Multiple client identification strategies
- **Distributed Rate Limiting** - Coordinated rate limiting across service instances

### Rate Limiting Policies
- **Fixed Window** - Allow specific number of requests per time window
- **Sliding Window** - More granular request rate control with sliding time windows
- **Token Bucket** - Allow burst requests with token replenishment
- **Concurrency Limiting** - Limit concurrent request processing

### Client Identification Strategies
- **IP Address-Based** - Rate limit based on client IP address
- **User-Based** - Rate limit based on authenticated user identity
- **API Key-Based** - Rate limit based on API key or client identifier
- **Custom Headers** - Rate limit based on custom request headers

## CORS Configuration

### CORS Policy Management
- **Policy-Based Configuration** - Named CORS policies for different scenarios
- **Environment-Specific Policies** - Different CORS policies for development and production
- **Dynamic Policy Configuration** - Runtime CORS policy configuration
- **Credential Support** - Handle requests with credentials appropriately

### Origin Management
- **Allowed Origins** - Configure specific allowed origins for cross-origin requests
- **Wildcard Support** - Support for wildcard origins in development
- **Subdomain Support** - Allow requests from subdomains
- **Protocol Flexibility** - Support for HTTP/HTTPS protocol differences

### CORS Headers Configuration
- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods** - Configure allowed HTTP methods
- **Access-Control-Allow-Headers** - Specify allowed request headers
- **Access-Control-Expose-Headers** - Expose specific response headers to clients
- **Access-Control-Max-Age** - Configure preflight request cache duration

## Integration with Service Defaults

### Kestrel Integration
- **Server-Level Configuration** - Configure rate limiting at the Kestrel server level
- **Middleware Pipeline Integration** - Proper ordering in middleware pipeline
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimize rate limiting for high-throughput scenarios
- **Resource Management** - Efficient memory and CPU usage for rate limiting

### Authentication Integration
- **Authenticated vs Anonymous** - Different rate limits for authenticated and anonymous users
- **Role-Based Rate Limiting** - Different rate limits based on user roles
- **Premium User Support** - Higher rate limits for premium or privileged users
- **Service Account Support** - Special rate limits for service accounts

## Rate Limiting Policies

### API Endpoint Protection
- **Per-Endpoint Policies** - Specific rate limits for different API endpoints
- **Resource-Based Limiting** - Rate limits based on resource types and operations
- **Method-Specific Limits** - Different limits for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Critical Path Protection** - Enhanced protection for critical business operations

### User Experience Optimization
- **Graceful Degradation** - Provide meaningful responses when limits are exceeded
- **Rate Limit Headers** - Include rate limit information in response headers
- **Retry Guidance** - Provide retry-after information for clients
- **Progressive Penalties** - Implement progressive penalty systems for repeated violations

### Abuse Prevention
- **Suspicious Activity Detection** - Detect and prevent abusive request patterns
- **Automatic Blocking** - Temporarily block clients exceeding limits
- **Whitelist Support** - Maintain whitelists for trusted clients
- **Blacklist Support** - Block known bad actors

## CORS Security

### Secure CORS Configuration
- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Allow only necessary origins and methods
- **Credential Handling** - Secure handling of credentials in CORS requests
- **Content Type Restrictions** - Restrict allowed content types for security
- **Header Validation** - Validate and sanitize CORS headers

### Attack Prevention
- **CSRF Protection** - Prevent cross-site request forgery through CORS
- **XSS Prevention** - Prevent cross-site scripting through proper CORS configuration
- **Data Exfiltration Prevention** - Prevent unauthorized data access through CORS
- **Origin Validation** - Strict validation of request origins

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Rate Limiting Metrics
- **Request Rate Monitoring** - Track request rates and patterns
- **Limit Violation Tracking** - Monitor rate limit violations and trends
- **Client Behavior Analysis** - Analyze client request patterns
- **Performance Impact Assessment** - Measure rate limiting impact on performance

### CORS Monitoring
- **CORS Request Tracking** - Monitor cross-origin request patterns
- **Preflight Request Analysis** - Analyze preflight request efficiency
- **Error Rate Monitoring** - Track CORS-related errors and failures
- **Origin Analysis** - Monitor request origins and patterns

### Alerting and Notifications
- **Abuse Detection Alerts** - Alert on potential abuse or unusual patterns
- **Rate Limit Threshold Alerts** - Notify when approaching rate limits
- **CORS Configuration Alerts** - Alert on CORS configuration issues
- **Performance Impact Alerts** - Alert on performance degradation

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- **Development Configuration** - Relaxed policies for development environments
- **Staging Configuration** - Production-like policies for staging
- **Production Configuration** - Strict security policies for production
- **Testing Configuration** - Special configuration for automated testing

### Dynamic Configuration
- **Runtime Configuration Changes** - Update policies without service restart
- **Feature Flags** - Toggle rate limiting features based on conditions
- **A/B Testing Support** - Test different rate limiting strategies
- **Emergency Controls** - Quick policy changes during incidents

## Error Handling

### Rate Limiting Errors
- **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** - Standard response for rate limit violations
- **Meaningful Error Messages** - Provide clear error descriptions
- **Retry Information** - Include retry-after headers and guidance
- **Context Preservation** - Maintain request context in error responses

### CORS Errors
- **CORS Policy Violations** - Handle CORS policy violations gracefully
- **Preflight Failures** - Proper error handling for preflight request failures
- **Origin Validation Errors** - Clear errors for invalid origins
- **Method Not Allowed** - Appropriate responses for disallowed methods

## Best Practices

### Rate Limiting Best Practices
- **Fair Usage Policies** - Implement fair and reasonable rate limits
- **Gradual Enforcement** - Gradually enforce rate limits to avoid disruption
- **Client Communication** - Clearly communicate rate limits to API consumers
- **Performance Testing** - Test rate limiting under realistic load conditions

### CORS Best Practices
- **Minimal Permissions** - Grant minimum necessary CORS permissions
- **Environment Awareness** - Use appropriate CORS policies for each environment
- **Regular Review** - Regularly review and update CORS policies
- **Security Assessment** - Regular security assessment of CORS configuration

### Operational Excellence
- **Monitoring and Alerting** - Comprehensive monitoring of rate limiting and CORS
- **Documentation** - Document rate limiting and CORS policies clearly
- **Client Support** - Provide support for clients dealing with rate limits
- **Incident Response** - Have procedures for handling rate limiting incidents
