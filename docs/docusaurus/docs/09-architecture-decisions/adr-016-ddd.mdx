# ADR-016: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

## Status

**Accepted** - July 2024

## Context

BookWorm's complex business domain requires a structured approach to manage domain complexity and ensure alignment between business requirements and technical implementation. The domain challenges include:

- **Complex Business Logic**: Book catalog management, order processing, inventory tracking, and customer relationship management
- **Multiple Bounded Contexts**: Distinct business areas with different vocabularies and rules (catalog, ordering, finance, rating)
- **Domain Expert Collaboration**: Need for close collaboration between developers and business domain experts
- **Business Rule Evolution**: Frequently changing business rules and policies requiring flexible domain models
- **Cross-Context Integration**: Managing relationships and data consistency across different domain contexts
- **Legacy Integration**: Incorporating existing business processes and data structures
- **Team Scaling**: Multiple development teams working on different domain areas simultaneously
- **Technical Complexity**: Balancing domain purity with technical infrastructure requirements
- **Model Integrity**: Maintaining domain model consistency and preventing anemic domain models
- **Strategic Design**: Identifying bounded contexts, context mapping, and integration patterns

The architecture must support rich domain models while enabling team autonomy and system scalability.

## Decision

Adopt **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** as the primary architectural approach with clear bounded context separation, rich domain models, and strategic design patterns to manage complexity and align technical implementation with business domain.

### DDD Implementation Strategy

#### Bounded Context Architecture

- **Context Boundaries**: Clear separation of business contexts with independent domain models
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent vocabulary within each context, shared between developers and domain experts
- **Context Integration**: Well-defined integration patterns between contexts using domain events and anti-corruption layers
- **Team Organization**: Development teams aligned with bounded contexts for domain expertise

#### Domain Modeling Approach

- **Rich Domain Models**: Business logic encapsulated in domain entities and value objects
- **Aggregate Design**: Consistent transaction boundaries with aggregate roots and domain invariants
- **Domain Events**: Business event modeling for loose coupling and eventual consistency
- **Repository Pattern**: Domain-focused data access abstraction without infrastructure concerns

### BookWorm Bounded Contexts

| Bounded Context  | Core Domain        | Subdomain Type | Team Ownership | Key Aggregates                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Catalog**      | Book Management    | Core           | Catalog Team   | Book, Category, Author, Publisher |
| **Ordering**     | Order Processing   | Core           | Order Team     | Order, OrderItem, Customer        |
| **Finance**      | Payment Processing | Supporting     | Finance Team   | Payment, Invoice, Transaction     |
| **Rating**       | Book Reviews       | Supporting     | Content Team   | Review, Rating, Feedback          |
| **Basket**       | Shopping Cart      | Supporting     | Commerce Team  | Basket, BasketItem                |
| **Notification** | Communication      | Generic        | Platform Team  | Notification, Template            |
| **Chat**         | Customer Support   | Supporting     | Support Team   | Conversation, Message             |

## Rationale

### Why Domain-Driven Design?

#### Business Alignment and Clarity

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between business experts and developers reduces miscommunication
2. **Business Focus**: Domain logic remains independent of technical concerns and infrastructure
3. **Model Integrity**: Rich domain models prevent anemic data models and scattered business logic
4. **Evolutionary Design**: Domain models can evolve with changing business requirements
5. **Domain Expert Collaboration**: Structured approach for incorporating business knowledge into software design

#### Strategic Design Benefits

1. **Bounded Context Separation**: Clear boundaries prevent model contamination and enable team autonomy
2. **Context Integration**: Well-defined integration patterns manage complexity between contexts
3. **Scalability**: Teams can work independently within their bounded contexts
4. **Legacy Integration**: Anti-corruption layers protect domain models from legacy system contamination
5. **Technical Architecture**: Strategic design guides microservice boundaries and data architecture

#### Tactical Design Advantages

1. **Aggregate Consistency**: Transaction boundaries ensure business invariants and data consistency
2. **Domain Events**: Loose coupling between contexts through domain-driven event modeling
3. **Repository Abstraction**: Domain-focused data access without infrastructure dependencies
4. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects for domain concepts with built-in validation
5. **Domain Services**: Stateless services for domain operations that don't belong to specific entities

### DDD Pattern Implementation

#### Domain Layer Architecture

1. **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle, encapsulating business logic and invariants
2. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing domain concepts without identity
3. **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries with aggregate roots managing invariants
4. **Domain Events**: Business events representing significant domain occurrences
5. **Domain Services**: Stateless services for operations spanning multiple aggregates

#### Application Layer Coordination

1. **Application Services**: Orchestrate domain operations and coordinate cross-aggregate transactions
2. **Command Handlers**: Process business commands and coordinate domain operations
3. **Query Handlers**: Handle read operations and return view models for presentation
4. **Event Handlers**: Process domain events and coordinate cross-context communication
5. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Protect domain models from external system contamination

#### Infrastructure Integration

1. **Repository Implementation**: Infrastructure-specific implementations of domain repository contracts
2. **Event Publishing**: Infrastructure services for publishing domain events to message brokers
3. **External Service Integration**: Adapter pattern for external API integration
4. **Data Persistence**: Object-relational mapping with domain-focused persistence strategies
5. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Infrastructure services for logging, monitoring, and security

## Implementation

### Bounded Context Integration

- **Domain Events**: Cross-context communication through published domain events
- **Integration Events**: Translation between domain events and integration events for external contexts
- **Context Mapping**: Explicit relationships between bounded contexts (Customer-Supplier, Conformist, Anti-Corruption Layer)
- **Shared Kernels**: Common domain concepts shared between specific contexts where appropriate
- **Published Language**: Well-defined schemas for cross-context data exchange

### Aggregate Design Principles

- **Consistency Boundaries**: Aggregates maintain business invariants within transaction boundaries
- **Identity Management**: Aggregate roots provide identity and control access to aggregate internals
- **Business Rules**: Domain logic encapsulated within aggregates, not leaked to application services
- **Event Publishing**: Domain events published for side effects and cross-aggregate coordination
- **Performance Optimization**: Aggregate design balanced between consistency and performance requirements

### Context Integration Configuration

```yaml
# Context mapping configuration
bounded_contexts:
  catalog:
    upstream_contexts: []
    downstream_contexts: [rating, ordering]
    integration_pattern: "published_language"

  ordering:
    upstream_contexts: [catalog, basket]
    downstream_contexts: [finance, notification]
    integration_pattern: "customer_supplier"

  finance:
    upstream_contexts: [ordering]
    downstream_contexts: [notification]
    integration_pattern: "conformist"
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Model Integrity**: Rich domain models with encapsulated business logic and invariants
- **Team Autonomy**: Clear bounded contexts enable independent team development
