# ADR-017: gRPC for Inter-Service Communication

## Status

**Accepted** - August 2024

## Context

BookWorm's microservices architecture requires efficient, type-safe, and high-performance communication between services for synchronous operations. The inter-service communication requirements include:

- **High Performance**: Low-latency communication for real-time operations like inventory checks and pricing queries
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and contract enforcement to prevent integration errors
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service endpoint resolution in containerized environments
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Communication between .NET services and potential future services in other languages
- **Streaming Capabilities**: Support for real-time data streaming and bidirectional communication
- **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing with health checking and failover
- **Monitoring Integration**: Distributed tracing and metrics collection for observability
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible API evolution with version management
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication
- **Developer Experience**: Code generation, tooling support, and debugging capabilities

The solution must complement the existing event-driven architecture while providing efficient synchronous communication patterns.

## Decision

Adopt **gRPC** as the primary protocol for synchronous inter-service communication, with HTTP/JSON APIs reserved for external client communication and specific integration scenarios.

### gRPC Implementation Strategy

#### Service Communication Architecture

- **Internal gRPC**: High-performance binary protocol for service-to-service communication
- **External HTTP APIs**: RESTful APIs for web clients and external integrations
- **Protocol Buffers**: Schema-first API design with code generation
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Istio/Linkerd integration for traffic management and security

#### Communication Patterns

- **Unary RPCs**: Traditional request-response patterns for simple operations
- **Server Streaming**: Real-time data feeds and large result set pagination
- **Client Streaming**: Bulk data uploads and batch processing operations
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time chat and collaborative features

### BookWorm gRPC Service Map

| Service      | gRPC APIs                       | Consumers                | Communication Pattern    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Catalog**  | BookService, CategoryService    | Ordering, Rating, Search | Unary RPC                |
| **Ordering** | OrderService, OrderQueryService | Finance, Notification    | Unary + Server Streaming |
| **Basket**   | BasketService                   | Ordering                 | Unary RPC                |

## Rationale

### Why gRPC?

#### Performance and Efficiency

1. **Binary Protocol**: HTTP/2-based binary protocol provides superior performance over JSON/HTTP
2. **Connection Multiplexing**: Single connection supports multiple concurrent requests with lower overhead
3. **Streaming Support**: Native support for streaming operations reduces memory usage and improves responsiveness
4. **Compression**: Built-in message compression reduces network bandwidth usage
5. **Connection Reuse**: Persistent connections reduce connection establishment overhead

#### Type Safety and Contract Management

1. **Protocol Buffers**: Strongly-typed schema definition with automatic code generation
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Schema evolution with backward compatibility guarantees
3. **Cross-Language Support**: Language-neutral schemas support polyglot microservices architecture
4. **Contract Enforcement**: Compile-time validation prevents integration errors
5. **Version Management**: Schema versioning with graceful handling of version mismatches

#### Developer Experience and Tooling

1. **Code Generation**: Automatic client and server stub generation from proto definitions
2. **IDE Integration**: Excellent tooling support in Visual Studio and other IDEs
3. **Testing Support**: Rich testing frameworks and mock generation capabilities
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting APIs through protocol buffer definitions
5. **Debugging Tools**: Comprehensive debugging and introspection capabilities

### gRPC vs Alternative Protocols

#### Advantages over HTTP/JSON APIs

1. **Performance**: 7-10x faster serialization and smaller message sizes
2. **Type Safety**: Compile-time contract validation vs runtime errors
3. **Streaming**: Native bidirectional streaming support
4. **Generated Clients**: Automatic client generation vs manual HTTP client implementation
5. **Network Efficiency**: Binary encoding and connection multiplexing

#### Advantages over Message Queues

1. **Synchronous Operations**: Direct request-response for immediate consistency requirements
2. **Lower Latency**: Sub-millisecond response times for real-time operations
3. **Simpler Flow Control**: Direct client-server communication without queue management
4. **Error Handling**: Immediate error responses vs delayed error processing
5. **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing with health checking

#### Integration with Event-Driven Architecture

1. **Complementary Patterns**: gRPC for synchronous operations, events for asynchronous integration
2. **Command Query Separation**: gRPC for queries, events for state changes
3. **Consistency Models**: Strong consistency via gRPC, eventual consistency via events
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimal protocol selection based on operation characteristics
5. **Hybrid Communication**: Services can expose both gRPC and event interfaces

## Implementation

### Service Implementation Architecture

- **Service Interface Definition**: Protocol buffer service definitions with comprehensive documentation
- **Server Implementation**: ASP.NET Core gRPC services implementing the generated interfaces
- **Client Integration**: Strongly-typed gRPC clients injected via dependency injection
- **Interceptors**: Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health checking with service-specific health indicators

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Integration

- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with interceptor implementation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control integrated with service methods
- **Logging**: Structured logging with request/response correlation
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and distributed tracing integration
- **Rate Limiting**: Service-level rate limiting with circuit breaker patterns

## Configuration

### gRPC Service Configuration

```csharp
// Server configuration
services.AddGrpc(options => options.EnableDetailedErrors = environment.IsDevelopment());

// Client configuration
services.AddGrpcClient<BookService.BookServiceClient>(options => options.Address = new Uri("https://catalog-service"));
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **High Performance**: Superior performance compared to HTTP/JSON for service-to-service communication
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents integration errors and improves developer productivity
- **Streaming Capabilities**: Native support for real-time and streaming operations
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible API evolution with protocol buffers
- **Cross-Platform**: Language-neutral schemas support future technology choices
- **Tooling Support**: Excellent development and debugging tools

### Negative

- **Browser Limitations**: Limited browser support requires HTTP/JSON gateway for web clients
- **Learning Curve**: Protocol buffers and gRPC concepts require team training
- **Debugging Complexity**: Binary protocol makes network-level debugging more challenging
- **Firewall Issues**: HTTP/2 may face firewall and proxy compatibility issues
- **Load Balancer Compatibility**: Some load balancers may not fully support HTTP/2 features

### Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                    | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                           |

| Team Learning Curve     | Low    | High        | Training programs, documentation, mentoring   |
