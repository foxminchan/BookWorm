# ADR-020: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Status

**Accepted** - March 2025

## Context

BookWorm's AI-driven features require secure and standardized access to various data sources, tools, and services to provide intelligent recommendations, automated support, and enhanced user experiences. The AI integration challenges include:

- **Secure Data Access**: AI models need secure access to customer data, order history, and catalog information
- **Tool Integration**: AI agents require access to various tools for automation and decision-making
- **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation context across multiple AI interactions
- **Permission Control**: Fine-grained access control for AI models to different data sources
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent interfaces for AI models to interact with BookWorm services
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Integration of different AI models (LLM, embedding, vision) with unified access patterns
- **Audit and Compliance**: Comprehensive logging of AI data access for security and compliance
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource utilization and connection pooling for AI operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI service failures
- **Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to data schemas and API interfaces used by AI models
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing AI model access to data sources for low-latency responses
- **Integration Testing**: Testing AI integrations with mock data sources and tools

The solution must provide a secure, standardized, and extensible framework for AI model integration that enables intelligent features while maintaining data security and system reliability.

## Decision

Adopt **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the standardized framework for AI model integration, enabling secure access to BookWorm's data sources, tools, and services while maintaining fine-grained permission control and comprehensive audit capabilities.

### MCP Integration Strategy

#### Secure AI Data Access

- **Resource Servers**: MCP servers providing secure access to BookWorm's databases, APIs, and services
- **Permission Framework**: Fine-grained permissions controlling AI model access to different data sources
- **Context Management**: Persistent context across AI interactions with conversation state management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all AI data access and tool usage

#### AI Tool Integration

- **Tool Servers**: MCP servers exposing BookWorm tools and automation capabilities to AI models
- **Function Calling**: Standardized function calling interface for AI models to invoke business operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for tool integration failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Resource usage controls to prevent AI model abuse of system resources

## Decision

Adopt **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools** as the foundational framework for standardizing development tools, workflows, and integrations across the BookWorm development ecosystem.

## Rationale

### Why Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

#### AI Model Integration Benefits
