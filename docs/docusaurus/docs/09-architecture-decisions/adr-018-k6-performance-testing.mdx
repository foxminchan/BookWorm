# ADR-018: K6 Performance Testing Framework

## Status

**Accepted** - February 2025

## Context

BookWorm's microservices architecture requires comprehensive performance testing to ensure scalability, reliability, and optimal user experience under various load conditions. The performance testing requirements include:

- **Load Testing**: Validate system behavior under expected production load levels
- **Stress Testing**: Determine system breaking points and failure modes under extreme load
- **Spike Testing**: Evaluate system response to sudden traffic increases
- **Volume Testing**: Test system performance with large datasets and high data volumes
- **Endurance Testing**: Validate system stability over extended periods
- **API Testing**: Test individual microservice APIs and inter-service communication performance
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated performance testing as part of deployment pipeline
- **Monitoring Integration**: Performance metrics collection and alerting
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Testing HTTP APIs, gRPC services, and WebSocket connections
- **Realistic Scenarios**: User journey simulation with realistic data patterns
- **Performance Budgets**: Automated performance regression detection
- **Scalability Planning**: Data-driven capacity planning and scaling decisions

The testing framework must integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure while providing developer-friendly scripting capabilities.

## Decision

Adopt **K6** as the primary performance testing framework with JavaScript-based test scripts, integrated with Prometheus monitoring and CI/CD pipeline automation for comprehensive performance validation.

### Performance Testing Strategy

#### Testing Pyramid Approach

- **Unit Performance Tests**: Individual API endpoint performance validation
- **Integration Performance Tests**: Cross-service communication performance testing
- **End-to-End Performance Tests**: Complete user journey performance scenarios
- **Infrastructure Performance Tests**: Database, cache, and messaging system performance

#### Load Testing Scenarios

- **Normal Load**: Typical production traffic patterns with realistic user behavior
- **Peak Load**: Maximum expected production load during high-traffic periods
- **Stress Load**: Beyond peak load to identify system breaking points
- **Spike Load**: Sudden traffic increases to test auto-scaling capabilities

    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },   // Steady state
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 },   // Peak load
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 },   // Peak steady
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },     // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'],   // 95% under 200ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],      // Error rate under 10%
    http_reqs: ['rate>100'],            // Min 100 RPS
  },
};
```

### Environment Configuration

```javascript
// Environment-specific configuration
const environments = {
  development: {
    baseUrl: 'https://dev-api.bookworm.local',
    users: 50,
    duration: '2m'
  },
  staging: {
    baseUrl: 'https://staging-api.bookworm.com',
    users: 200,
    duration: '10m'
