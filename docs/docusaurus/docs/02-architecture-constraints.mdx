# Architecture Constraints

Architecture constraints define the boundaries and non-negotiable conditions under which the BookWorm system must be designed and implemented. They ensure alignment across teams, reduce architectural drift, and make explicit the trade-offs that were accepted.

## Summary

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  These architecture constraints establish the <b>non-negotiable foundation</b> of the system while making clear which areas are <b>flexible</b>. They balance innovation (e.g., Aspire, Qdrant) with proven practices (e.g., PostgreSQL, DDD), and provide guardrails for teams to build consistently and securely within agreed boundaries.
