## Overview

The Store domain represents the heart of BookWorm's business operations, orchestrating all aspects of the online bookstore experience from product discovery to order fulfillment.

## 🎯 Domain Vision

To create a seamless, scalable, and maintainable e-commerce platform that delights book lovers while demonstrating modern software architecture best practices.

## 🏗️ Strategic Design

### Domain Boundaries

The Store domain is strategically divided into two subdomains based on our [microservices architecture](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-001-microservices-architecture):

1. **[Catalog Subdomain](/docs/domains/catalog/1.0.0)** - Core subdomain
   - Product information management
   - Search and discovery
   - Ratings and reviews
   - AI-powered recommendations

2. **[Orders Subdomain](/docs/domains/orders/1.0.0)** - Core subdomain
   - Shopping cart management
   - Order processing workflow
   - Payment orchestration
   - Customer notifications

### Ubiquitous Language

| Term        | Definition                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Book**    | A physical or digital publication available for purchase |
| **Basket**  | A temporary collection of items selected by a customer   |
| **Order**   | A confirmed purchase request with payment information    |
| **Catalog** | The complete inventory of available books                |
| **Rating**  | Customer feedback including stars and written reviews    |
| **Saga**    | A distributed transaction pattern for order processing   |

## 💼 Event Storming

We conducted an [event storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) session for the Store domain to understand its complexities and subdomain interactions. This session helped us map key events, commands, and aggregates, aligning our technical implementation with business needs for robust functionality.

Our implementation follows an [event-driven architecture with CQRS pattern](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-002-event-driven-cqrs) to ensure scalability and loose coupling between services.

## 📊 High-level architecture

To effectively visualize and understand the architecture of the BookWorm system, we will employ the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/). This model allows us to represent the system at various levels of abstraction, providing a comprehensive view of its structure and interactions.

Our architecture follows several key architectural decisions:

- [Microservices Architecture](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-018-k6-performance-testing) for service boundaries
- [Aspire for Cloud-Native Development](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-003-aspire-cloud-native) for orchestration
- [Container-First Deployment Strategy](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-007-aca-deployment) for consistency
- [API Gateway Pattern](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-008-api-gateway) for unified access

The data storage strategy is detailed in our [PostgreSQL database decision](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-004-postgresql-database), with event-driven communication patterns outlined in our [Event-Driven CQRS approach](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-002-event-driven-cqrs).

AI-powered features are implemented following our [AI Integration Strategy](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-009-ai-integration), while real-time communication uses [SignalR](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture-decisions/adr-006-signalr-realtime).
