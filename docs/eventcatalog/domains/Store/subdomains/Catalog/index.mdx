## Overview

The Catalog domain is responsible for managing the products that are available for purchase in the BookWorm platform and handling product ratings and reviews. Built following our [microservices architecture](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture/adr/adr-001-microservices-architecture.html) principles, it consists of three main services:

1. **Product Service**: Serves as the central repository for all book-related information including metadata, inventory status, pricing, and categorization. It allows customers to browse the extensive collection of books, view detailed product information, and search based on various criteria.

2. **Rating Service**: Manages customer reviews, ratings, and feedback for books in the catalog. It provides functionality for users to rate books, write reviews, and view aggregated rating statistics.

3. **Chat Service**: Provides AI-powered conversational capabilities for book recommendations and customer support, implementing our [AI Integration Strategy](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture/adr/adr-009-ai-integration.html).

The domain provides robust management capabilities for product categories, series, collections, publishers, and user-generated content. It maintains relationships between books, such as series orders, related titles, author bibliographies, and user reviews.

Data persistence follows our [PostgreSQL database strategy](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture/adr/adr-004-postgresql-database.html), while service communication uses [event-driven patterns](https://foxminchan.github.io/BookWorm/architecture/adr/adr-002-event-driven-cqrs.html) for loose coupling.

For administrators, the Catalog domain offers comprehensive management tools for both product information and user-generated content, allowing them to:

- Add and update book information
- Manage inventory levels
- Control pricing and discounts
- Moderate user reviews and ratings
- Generate reports on product performance and user feedback

As a core domain in the BookWorm ecosystem, Catalog integrates with other services like the Basket domain for purchasing flows and the Ordering domain for inventory verification during checkout processes.
