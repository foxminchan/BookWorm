## Overview

The Rating Service represents a distinct bounded context within the BookWorm ecosystem, responsible for managing user feedback and ratings for books. As a core domain service, it implements Domain-Driven Design principles to maintain a clean separation of concerns while providing critical functionality for the user experience.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Feedback Collection**: Capturing user ratings, reviews, and sentiment analysis
- **Rating Aggregation**: Computing real-time rating metrics and statistics
- **Content Moderation**: Validating and filtering review content for quality
- **Event Broadcasting**: Publishing domain events for system-wide rating updates
- **Analytics Support**: Providing rating trends and insights for business intelligence
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying and preventing rating manipulation

    Container_Boundary(rating, "Rating Service") {
        Container_Boundary(application, "Application") {
            Component(ratingEndpoint, "Rating Endpoints", ".NET", "Manages feedback and rating operations")
            Component(ratingFacade, "Rating Manager", ".NET", "Core business logic for rating management")
            Component(eventHandler, "Event Handler", ".NET", "Handles event publishing/subscribing")
        }

        Container_Boundary(infrastructure, "Infrastructure") {
            ComponentDb(ratingDb, "Rating DB", "PostgreSQL", "Stores user feedback and ratings")
            ComponentQueue(eventBus, "Event Bus", "RabbitMQ", "Handles async communication")
        }
    }

    Rel(ratingEndpoint, ratingFacade, "Uses", "Internal")
    Rel(ratingFacade, ratingDb, "Reads/Writes", "SQL")
    Rel(ratingFacade, eventHandler, "Uses", "Internal")
    BiRel(eventHandler, eventBus, "Publishes/Subscribes", "Async")

    UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow="3", $c4BoundaryInRow="1")
```

### Domain Events

The service emits domain events such as `FeedbackCreatedEvent` and `FeedbackDeletedEvent` to notify other bounded contexts about changes in the rating domain. These events enable loose coupling between services while maintaining data consistency.

### Integration Points

Rating Service integrates with:

- **Catalog Service**: Updates book rating information
- **Notification Service**: Triggers notifications for review responses

### Implementation Details

The service follows the CQRS pattern with separate command and query models, enabling optimized read and write operations. The repository pattern is used for data access, ensuring persistence concerns remain separated from domain logic.

## Core Features

| Feature             | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add Feedback**    | Allows users to submit feedback and ratings for books, storing them in the database.   |
| **Delete Feedback** | Supports the removal of user feedback, updating the book's rating metrics accordingly. |
| **Get Feedbacks**   | Provides an API endpoint to retrieve feedback for a specific book or user.             |

## Technical Architecture

The Rating Service is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture following these key design principles:

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Commands
        CC[CreateFeedbackCommand]
        DC[DeleteFeedbackCommand]
    end

    subgraph Queries
        LQ[ListFeedbackQuery]
    end

    subgraph Domain
        F[Feedback Aggregate]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure
        DB[(Cosmos DB)]
    end

    CC --> F
    DC --> F
    F --> DB
    DB --> LQ
```

The service implements CQRS pattern with:

- **Command Stack**: Handles write operations through commands like `CreateFeedbackCommand` and `DeleteFeedbackCommand`
- **Query Stack**: Manages read operations with queries like `ListFeedbackQuery`
- **MediatR Pipeline**: Processes commands and queries with cross-cutting concerns:
  - Validation behavior
  - Activity tracking for observability
  - Logging behavior

### Event-Driven Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Rating Service
    participant Event Bus
    participant Catalog Service

    Client->>Rating Service: POST /api/v1/feedbacks
    Rating Service->>Rating Service: Create Feedback
    Rating Service->>Event Bus: Publish FeedbackCreatedIntegrationEvent
    Event Bus->>Catalog Service: Consume FeedbackCreatedIntegrationEvent
    Catalog Service->>Catalog Service: Update Book Rating
```

The service publishes domain events that are transformed into integration events for cross-service communication:

- **Domain Events**: `FeedbackCreatedEvent`, `FeedbackDeletedEvent`
- **Integration Events**: `FeedbackCreatedIntegrationEvent`, `FeedbackDeletedIntegrationEvent`
- **Event Bus**: Implemented with MassTransit for reliable message delivery
- **Inbox/Outbox Pattern**: Ensures at-least-once delivery semantics

## Infrastructure

This service is built using C# and .NET Core, leveraging Entity Framework Core for data access and Azure Cosmos Database for persistence. The service is containerized using Docker and deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalability and reliability.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(logos:microsoft-azure)[API]

    service server(logos:docker-icon)[Server] in api
    service db(logos:postgresql)[Database] in api

    db:L -- R:server
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Read Replicas**: Queries directed to read replicas for scalability
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with Redis for hot data
- **Batch Processing**: Aggregated rating updates processed in batches
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections with pooling
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking I/O throughout the stack

## Key Metrics

- **Business Metrics**

  - Average rating per book
  - Total feedbacks submitted
  - Moderation approval rate
  - User engagement rate

- **Technical Metrics**
  - API response times (P50, P95, P99)
  - Cache hit ratio
  - Event processing lag
  - Database query performance
  - Moderation service latency
