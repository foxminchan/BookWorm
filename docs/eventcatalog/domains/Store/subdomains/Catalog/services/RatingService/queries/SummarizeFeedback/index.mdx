## Overview

The **Summarize Feedback** endpoint leverages advanced AI capabilities through Microsoft Agent Framework to provide intelligent, contextual summaries of user feedback and ratings for books. This sophisticated query operation goes beyond simple aggregation by using a specialized RatingAgent that analyzes sentiment, calculates quality metrics, and classifies book performance into distinct categories.

As a core read operation within the Rating bounded context, this endpoint implements CQRS principles with AI-enhanced processing, enabling clients to receive comprehensive feedback insights without impacting the command-side operations of the Rating domain.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Microsoft Agent Framework with Ollama integration for advanced text processing
- **Quality Classification**: Automatically categorizes books as "Best Seller", "Good", "Bad", or "No Data" based on sophisticated algorithms
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides instant feedback summaries with low-latency response times
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Considers rating patterns, review quality, and temporal factors in analysis
- **Rate Limited**: Implements per-user rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/feedbacks/{bookId}/summarize" \
