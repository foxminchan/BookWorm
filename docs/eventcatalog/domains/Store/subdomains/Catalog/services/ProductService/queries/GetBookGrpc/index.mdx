    This endpoint (`GetBookGrpc`) is currently not utilized by any service in
    BookWorm.

    For retrieving books, consider using the `ListBookGrpc` endpoint, which is
    designed for listing and querying books efficiently.
---

## Overview

This gRPC endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a specific Book aggregate root from the Catalog bounded context by its unique identifier. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entity to a BookDto response through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.

### Key Features

- **High Performance**: gRPC binary protocol for efficient data transfer
- **Strong Typing**: Protocol buffer definitions ensure type safety
- **Streaming Support**: Capable of server streaming for bulk operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with any gRPC-compatible client

## Usage

### Call GetBook using grpcurl

You can use [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) to call the `GetBook` method of the `BookGrpcService` defined in your `book.proto`:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -d '{"bookId": "<BOOK_ID>"}' \
  localhost:5001 \
  CatalogApi.BookGrpcService/GetBook
```

- Replace `<BOOK_ID>` with the actual book ID (string).
- Adjust the host/port (`localhost:5001`) as needed for your environment.
- The response will be a `BookResponse` message as defined in your proto:

```json title="200 OK"
{
  "id": "<BOOK_ID>",
  "name": "Atomic Habits",
  "price": { "units": 12, "nanos": 0 },
  "priceSale": { "units": 10, "nanos": 0 },
  "status": "InStock"
}
```
