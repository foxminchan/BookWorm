## Overview

This endpoint allows for the removal of a Category entity from the Catalog domain. Following Domain-Driven Design principles, this operation:

- Respects the Category aggregate boundary
- Enforces domain invariants and business rules
- Validates that the category can be safely removed without violating referential integrity
- Returns proper error responses if the operation violates any domain constraints
- Requires administrative privileges to execute
  The implementation uses CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern with a `DeleteCategoryCommand` processed by MediatR, maintaining separation between the command interface and the domain logic.

:::warning
This endpoint requires administrative privileges. Only users with the Admin policy can perform this operation.
:::

:::note[Important Validation Rules]

1. Categories with associated products cannot be deleted until those relationships are removed first
2. The category ID must exist in the system
3. The category ID must be a valid GUID format
