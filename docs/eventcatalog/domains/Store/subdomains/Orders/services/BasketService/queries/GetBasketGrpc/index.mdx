## Overview

This gRPC endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a specific Basket aggregate root from the Orders bounded context by its user identifier. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entity to a BasketDto response through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.

## Usage

### Call GetBasket using grpcurl

You can use [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) to call the `GetBasket` method of the `BasketGrpcService` defined in your `basket.proto`:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -d '{}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  localhost:5001 \
  BasketApi.BasketGrpcService/GetBasket
```

- This endpoint does not require any request fields (uses `google.protobuf.Empty`).
- Adjust the host/port (`localhost:5001`) as needed for your environment.
- The response will be a `BasketResponse` message as defined in your proto:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "items": [
    { "id": "...", "quantity": 2 },
    // ... more items ...
  ]
}
```

<SchemaViewer file="response-200.json" maxHeight="500" id="response-200" />

- The `Authorization` header is used to pass the JWT token for user authentication. Replace `<token>` with a valid JWT token.
