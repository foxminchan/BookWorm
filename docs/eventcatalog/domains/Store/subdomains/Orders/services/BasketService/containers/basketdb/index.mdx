## Overview

The Basket Database is a high-performance Redis-based data store that manages customer shopping baskets in the BookWorm e-commerce system. Operating on Redis 8.2, this in-memory database provides ultra-fast read and write operations for shopping cart data, ensuring seamless user experience during the shopping journey. Unlike traditional relational databases, Redis's key-value architecture delivers sub-millisecond response times, making it ideal for the transient, high-frequency nature of shopping basket operations.

### Why Redis for Baskets?

**Performance**
- Sub-millisecond read/write latency (typically less than 1ms)
- In-memory operations eliminate disk I/O bottlenecks
- Supports 100,000+ operations per second per node

**Ephemeral Nature**
- Shopping baskets are temporary by nature
- Most baskets are abandoned (60-70% abandonment rate)
- No need for durable storage of transient data
- Automatic expiration support (TTL)

**Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling through Redis Cluster
- Built-in replication for high availability
- No complex table joins or indexing overhead

**Simplicity**
- Simple key-value operations: GET, SET, DELETE
- Hash operations for structured basket data
- Native JSON serialization support

### Connection Management

The repository uses `IConnectionMultiplexer` from StackExchange.Redis with:
- Connection pooling for optimal resource usage
- Semaphore-based locking (`SemaphoreSlim`) to prevent race conditions
- Thread-safe database access
- Automatic reconnection on failures

## Performance & Optimization

### Performance Characteristics

**Target Metrics**:
- Read latency: p99 less than 5ms
- Write latency: p99 less than 10ms
- Throughput: 50,000+ ops/second
- Availability: 99.9% uptime

**Actual Performance**:
- Average read: 1-2ms
- Average write: 2-3ms
- Peak throughput: 80,000+ ops/second

### Optimization Techniques

**JSON Serialization**:
- Source-generated serializers (zero reflection)
- UTF8 encoding for efficient wire format
- Minimal allocations during serialization

**Connection Pooling**:
- Reused multiplexer connections
- Single `IConnectionMultiplexer` instance per service
- Thread-safe database access via semaphore

**Hash Operations**:
- O(1) complexity for get/set/delete operations
- No full scan operations
- Efficient memory usage with Redis hashing

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Performance Indicators

**Operational Metrics**:
- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of successful basket retrievals
- **Write Success Rate**: Should be greater than 99.9%
- **Connection Health**: Active connections, failed connections
- **Latency Distribution**: p50, p95, p99 response times

**Business Metrics**:
- **Active Baskets**: Current number of baskets in Redis
- **Average Items per Basket**: Indicates customer engagement
- **Basket Abandonment Rate**: Baskets not converted to orders
- **Basket Size Distribution**: Understand typical basket patterns

### Health Checks

The Basket Service includes Redis health checks:
- Periodic connection validation
- Database availability checks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Exposed via `/health` endpoint

## Security & Data Classification

### Classification Details

- **Classification**: Internal - Contains customer shopping data
- **Access Mode**: Read/Write - Full CRUD operations for authorized services
- **Residency**: East Asia region - Data locality for primary user base
- **Authoritative**: True - Single source of truth for active basket state

### Security Considerations

**Data Protection**:
- Customer IDs stored as GUIDs (non-sequential, harder to enumerate)
- No sensitive payment information stored in baskets
- Product references only (IDs, not full product data)
- Network encryption in transit (TLS)

**Access Control**:
- Service-level authentication via Keycloak
- No direct external access to Redis
- API gateway enforces authorization
- Customer can only access their own basket

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies

**Catalog Service (gRPC)**:
- Validates product existence during basket operations
- Retrieves current product prices and availability
- Ensures basket items reference valid products

### Downstream Consumers

**Ordering Service**:
- Reads basket data when order is placed
- Triggers basket deletion after successful order creation
- Receives `PlaceOrderCommand` event from basket

**Notification Service**:
- May read basket data for abandoned cart reminders
- Sends notifications based on basket state changes

## Event-Driven Integration

### Published Events

**BasketDeletedCompletedEvent**:
- Published when basket is successfully deleted
- Triggers cleanup in dependent services
- Contains customer ID and timestamp

**BasketDeletedFailedEvent**:
- Published when basket deletion fails
- Triggers retry logic or manual intervention
- Contains customer ID, error details, and timestamp

### Consumed Commands

**PlaceOrderCommand**:
- Received from order workflow
- Triggers basket-to-order conversion
- Results in basket deletion and order creation

## Disaster Recovery & High Availability

### Backup Strategy

**Primary**: Redis persistence disabled (ephemeral data)
- Shopping baskets are recreatable
- No backup needed for transient data
- Reduces storage costs and complexity

**Optional**: Redis RDB snapshots for debugging
- Periodic snapshots for production troubleshooting
- Not used for disaster recovery
- Retained for 7 days maximum

### High Availability

**Redis Configuration**:
- Master-replica replication
- Sentinel for automatic failover
- Sub-second failover time
- Aspire handles connection string updates

**Failover Behavior**:
- Minimal data loss (replication lag less than 100ms)
- Automatic client reconnection
- Circuit breaker for degraded scenarios
- Graceful degradation: return empty basket if Redis unavailable

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

**Redis Cluster**:
- Horizontal scaling for higher throughput
- Sharding for larger datasets
- Multi-region replication for global customers

**Advanced Caching**:
- Cache-aside pattern for product data
- Local in-memory cache (L1) with Redis as L2
- Reduce Redis roundtrips for frequently accessed baskets

**Analytics Integration**:
- Stream basket changes to analytics platform
- Real-time dashboards for basket metrics
- Machine learning for abandonment prediction

**TTL Management**:
- Automatic expiration of abandoned baskets
- Configurable TTL based on customer behavior
- Periodic cleanup jobs for expired data
