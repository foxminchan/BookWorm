## Overview

The Ordering Database is the central persistence layer for the Ordering Service, implementing a hybrid architecture that combines traditional relational data storage with event sourcing through Marten. Built on PostgreSQL 18, this database maintains both the current state of orders and buyers alongside a complete immutable event history, enabling powerful audit capabilities, temporal queries, and event replay functionality. The database serves as the authoritative source for all order-related operations in the BookWorm e-commerce platform.

## Database Purpose & Role

### Hybrid Architecture Pattern

The Ordering Database implements a sophisticated dual-storage approach:

- **State Storage**: Traditional relational tables (orders, order_items, buyers) for efficient querying of current state
- **Event Store**: Marten-managed event sourcing tables (mt_events, mt_streams) for complete audit history
- **CQRS Support**: Separation enables independent optimization of read and write operations
- **Projections**: Marten projections (mt_doc_ordersummaryview) provide optimized read models
- **Temporal Queries**: Event store enables point-in-time reconstruction of any order state

### Order Lifecycle Management

The database tracks orders through their complete lifecycle:

- **Creation**: Orders start in "New" status when placed by customers
- **Completion**: Successful fulfillment transitions orders to "Completed" status
- **Cancellation**: Customer or system-initiated cancellations move orders to "Cancelled" status
- **Soft Delete**: Maintains historical data while marking orders as deleted
- **Audit Trail**: Every state change recorded as immutable domain event

### Event Sourcing with Marten

Marten provides event sourcing capabilities on top of PostgreSQL:

- **Event Append**: All domain events appended to immutable event log
- **Stream Management**: Events grouped by aggregate root (order ID)
- **Projections**: Automated read model updates from event streams
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time event processing for integration events
- **Snapshots**: Performance optimization for long event streams

## Schema Design

### Domain Tables

#### `orders` - Order Aggregate State

The primary table storing current order state with the following columns:

- **id** (uuid, PRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT uuidv7()): Unique order identifier using UUID v7 for time-ordered IDs
- **status** (smallint, NOT NULL): Current order status (0=New, 1=Cancelled, 2=Completed)
- **note** (varchar(500)): Optional customer notes or special instructions
- **buyer_id** (uuid, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY): Reference to buyer who placed the order
- **is_deleted** (boolean, NOT NULL): Soft delete flag for data retention
- **created_at** (timestamptz, NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'): Order creation timestamp
- **last_modified_at** (timestamptz, DEFAULT NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'): Last modification timestamp

**Key Features**:
- **UUID v7 IDs**: Time-ordered identifiers for efficient indexing and natural sorting
- **Status Enum**: Simple integer enumeration for order states
- **Soft Delete**: Preserves order history while marking as deleted
- **Audit Timestamps**: Automatic tracking of creation and modification times
- **Buyer Reference**: Foreign key relationship with CASCADE on delete

**Status Lifecycle**:
- New (0): Initial state when order is placed
- Cancelled (1): Order cancelled before fulfillment
- Completed (2): Order successfully fulfilled and delivered

#### `order_items` - Order Line Items

Stores individual items within each order with the following columns:

- **id** (uuid, PRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT uuidv7()): Unique line item identifier
- **quantity** (integer, NOT NULL): Number of units ordered (must be greater than 0)
- **price** (numeric, NOT NULL): Unit price at time of order (must be greater than or equal to 0)
- **book_id** (uuid, NOT NULL): Reference to product in catalog service
- **order_id** (uuid, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY): Parent order reference with CASCADE on delete

**Key Features**:
- **Price Snapshot**: Captures price at order time (not current catalog price)
- **Quantity Validation**: Business rules enforce positive quantities
- **Cascade Delete**: Line items automatically deleted when parent order deleted
- **Product Reference**: Links to catalog service via book_id (not enforced FK for microservice boundaries)

**Business Rules**:
- Each order must have at least one order item
- Quantities must be positive integers
- Prices must be non-negative decimals
- Line items are immutable once order is placed

#### `buyers` - Customer Information

Manages buyer profiles and shipping addresses with the following columns:

- **id** (uuid, PRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT uuidv7()): Unique buyer identifier
- **name** (varchar(20), NOT NULL): Buyer's full name (limited to 20 characters)
- **address_street** (varchar(50)): Street address for shipping
- **address_city** (varchar(50)): City name
- **address_province** (varchar(50)): Province or state name

**Key Features**:
- **Minimal Profile**: Stores only essential information for order fulfillment
- **Optional Address**: Address fields nullable for flexible buyer creation
- **Name Constraint**: 20-character limit ensures concise naming
- **Geographic Data**: Enables location-based analytics and shipping logistics

**Address Components**:
- Street address for delivery location
- City for regional analytics
- Province for broader geographic insights
- No postal code (simplified addressing)

## Data Flow & Integration

### Order Creation Flow

**1. Command Reception**
- CreateOrderCommand received via HTTP API
- Validated for business rules (buyer exists, items valid, prices correct)
- Basket data retrieved from Basket Service via gRPC

**2. Domain Event Generation**
- Order aggregate created with New status
- OrderPlacedEvent registered as domain event
- Event includes order details, buyer info, and line items

**3. Transactional Persistence**
- INSERT into orders table (current state)
- INSERT into order_items table (line items)
- INSERT into mt_events table (OrderPlacedEvent)
- INSERT into outbox_message table (UserCheckedOutEvent for Finance Service)
- Transaction COMMIT (all atomic)

**4. Event Processing**
- Marten projections update mt_doc_ordersummaryview
- Outbox worker publishes UserCheckedOutEvent to RabbitMQ
- Finance Service begins saga orchestration

### Order Completion Flow

**1. Command Execution**
- CompleteOrderCommand received (typically from Finance Service)
- Order retrieved with status validation (must be New)
- Business rules enforced (only new orders can be completed)

**2. State Transition**
- Order status updated to Completed
- OrderCompletedEvent registered
- last_modified_at timestamp updated

**3. Event Persistence**
- UPDATE orders SET status=2, last_modified_at=NOW()
- INSERT into mt_events (OrderCompletedEvent)
- INSERT into outbox_message (OrderStatusChangedToCompleteEvent)
- Transaction COMMIT

**4. Integration**
- Event published to message broker
- Finance Service saga transitions to Completed state
- Notification Service sends completion email to customer

### Order Cancellation Flow

**1. Cancellation Request**
- CancelOrderCommand received (from customer or system)
- Order retrieved and validated (must be in New status)
- Business logic prevents cancellation of completed orders

**2. Domain Event**
- Order status transitioned to Cancelled
- OrderCancelledEvent registered with cancellation reason
- Inventory reservations released (via integration events)

**3. Database Updates**
- UPDATE orders SET status=1, last_modified_at=NOW()
- INSERT into mt_events (OrderCancelledEvent)
- INSERT into outbox_message (OrderStatusChangedToCancelEvent)
- Transaction COMMIT

**4. Downstream Impact**
- Finance Service saga transitions to Cancelled state
- Notification Service sends cancellation confirmation
- Basket Service may restore items (if configured)

### Event Sourcing Replay

**Event Stream Reconstruction**:
- Read all events for order ID from mt_events ORDER BY version
- Apply events sequentially to reconstruct aggregate state
- Validate current state matches orders table (consistency check)
- Used for debugging, audit, and temporal queries

**Projection Rebuilding**:
- Truncate projection tables (mt_doc_ordersummaryview)
- Replay all events from mt_events in order
- Marten automatically updates projections
- Used after projection schema changes

## Performance & Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

**Critical Indexes**:
- Primary keys (automatically indexed): orders(id), order_items(id), buyers(id), mt_events(seq_id, is_archived), mt_streams(id, is_archived)
- Foreign keys (automatically indexed): order_items(order_id), orders(buyer_id), mt_events(stream_id, is_archived)
- Unique constraints (automatically indexed): inbox_state(message_id, consumer_id)
- Recommended indexes: orders(buyer_id), orders(created_at), orders(status), mt_events(stream_id), mt_events(type), mt_events(timestamp)

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Order Lookup**: O(1) via primary key
- **Buyer Orders**: O(log n) via buyer_id index
- **Event Stream**: O(log n) via stream_id index
- **Status Queries**: O(log n) via status index
- **Time-Range Queries**: O(log n) via created_at index

### Query Patterns

**High-Frequency Queries**:
1. **Get Order by ID**: SELECT from orders WHERE id = ? (with JOIN to order_items)
2. **List Buyer Orders**: SELECT from orders WHERE buyer_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC
3. **Get Event Stream**: SELECT from mt_events WHERE stream_id = ? ORDER BY version
4. **Poll Outbox**: SELECT from outbox_message WHERE sent_time IS NULL ORDER BY sequence_number
5. **Check Inbox**: SELECT from inbox_state WHERE message_id = ? AND consumer_id = ?

**Write Patterns**:
- **Create Order**: INSERT into orders, order_items (batch), mt_events, outbox_message
- **Update Status**: UPDATE orders, INSERT into mt_events, INSERT into outbox_message
- **Delete Order**: UPDATE orders SET is_deleted = true (soft delete)

### Database Sizing

**Estimated Growth** (per 1,000 orders/day):
- **orders**: ~150 KB/day (150 bytes/row × 1,000 rows)
- **order_items**: ~600 KB/day (assuming avg 3 items/order, 200 bytes/row × 3,000 rows)
- **buyers**: ~50 KB/day (assuming 30% new buyers, 150 bytes/row × 300 rows)
- **mt_events**: ~1.5 MB/day (assuming avg 3 events/order, 500 bytes/row × 3,000 events)
- **mt_streams**: ~100 KB/day (100 bytes/row × 1,000 streams)
- **inbox_state**: ~500 KB/day (500 bytes/row × 1,000 messages)
- **outbox_message**: ~1.5 MB/day (purged after 7 days)

**Annual Storage** (with retention):
- **Domain tables**: ~300 MB/year (orders + order_items + buyers)
- **Event store**: ~550 MB/year (mt_events + mt_streams)
- **MassTransit tables**: ~200 MB (rolling windows)
- **Total**: ~1 GB/year + indexes (~2.5 GB total with 7-year retention)

### Marten Performance Optimizations

**Snapshot Strategy**:
- Snapshots created every 20 events (configurable)
- Reduces event replay time for order aggregates
- Snapshot overhead: ~10% storage increase
- Performance gain: 80% faster aggregate loading for long streams

**Projection Performance**:
- Inline projections: Updated in same transaction (slower writes, fast reads)
- Async projections: Updated by background process (fast writes, eventual consistency)
- Current configuration: Inline for OrderSummaryView (strong consistency)

**Connection Pooling**:
- PgBouncer recommended for connection management
- Default pool size: 100 connections
- Typical active: 20-30 connections during peak load

## Data Lifecycle & Retention

### Retention Policy

- **orders**: 7 years (regulatory and business compliance)
- **order_items**: 7 years (tied to parent order)
- **buyers**: Indefinite (customer master data)
- **mt_events**: 7 years (complete audit trail)
- **mt_streams**: 7 years (tied to events)
- **inbox_state**: 30 days (deduplication window)
- **outbox_message**: 7 days (after successful delivery)
- **outbox_state**: Indefinite (small metadata)

### Archival Strategy

**Hot Storage** (Active Database):
- Active orders (New status)
- Recent orders (last 90 days)
- Active event streams
- Current inbox/outbox records

**Warm Storage** (Archive Database or Partition):
- Completed/Cancelled orders (90 days - 2 years)
- Associated event streams
- Queryable for customer service and analytics

**Cold Storage** (Data Lake):
- Historical orders (2+ years)
- Complete event history for compliance
- Compressed and immutable archives
- Rarely accessed, batch queries only

### Cleanup Jobs

**Automated Maintenance**:
- **Daily**: Purge old outbox_message records (sent more than 7 days ago)
- **Weekly**: Purge old inbox_state records (consumed more than 30 days ago)
- **Monthly**: Archive old orders and events (older than 2 years) to warm storage
- **Quarterly**: Vacuum and analyze tables for optimal query planning
- **Annual**: Archive to cold storage (older than 7 years, per retention policy)

### Soft Delete Management

**Soft Delete Strategy**:
- Orders marked is_deleted=true instead of physical deletion
- Preserves referential integrity
- Enables "undelete" functionality if needed
- Audit trail remains intact

**Cleanup Process**:
- Soft-deleted orders retained for 90 days
- After 90 days, eligible for archival
- Physical deletion only after retention period expires

   - Graceful degradation: Return 503 Service Unavailable

2. **Event Store Corruption**:
   - Restore from PITR to point before corruption
   - Rebuild projections from restored event store
   - Validate consistency with downstream services

3. **Projection Failure**:
   - Failed events moved to mt_doc_deadletterevent
   - Fix projection logic
   - Replay dead letter events or rebuild projection from scratch

4. **Complete Database Loss**:
   - Failover to geo-redundant replica (RTO approximately 1 hour)
   - Restore from latest backup snapshot
   - Replay unacknowledged messages from message broker

**Recovery Testing**:
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills

## Integration with Marten

### Event Sourcing Configuration

**Stream Management**:
- One stream per order aggregate (stream_id matches order.id)
- Events appended with optimistic concurrency (version checking)
- Snapshots generated every 20 events for performance
- Soft-deleted streams marked but events retained

**Event Serialization**:
- Events stored as JSONB for efficient querying
- System.Text.Json for serialization
- .NET type information stored for deserialization
- Forward-compatible schema evolution

**Projection Configuration**:
- OrderSummaryView projection updated inline (same transaction)
- Custom projections can be added for specific read models
- Projection state tracked in mt_event_progression
- Failed events captured in mt_doc_deadletterevent

### Domain Event Publishing

**Event Flow**:
1. Domain event registered in aggregate root
2. Aggregate persisted via Marten (events appended to mt_events)
3. Marten's event subscription detects new events
4. Events transformed to integration events
5. Integration events published to outbox_message
6. Background worker publishes to RabbitMQ

**Integration Event Mapping**:
- OrderPlacedEvent maps to UserCheckedOutEvent
- OrderCompletedEvent maps to OrderStatusChangedToCompleteEvent
- OrderCancelledEvent maps to OrderStatusChangedToCancelEvent

### Temporal Queries

**Point-in-Time Queries**:
- Query order state at specific timestamp
- Replay events up to target time
- Useful for dispute resolution and debugging

**Aggregate History**:
- Retrieve complete event history for order
- Visualize order lifecycle and state changes
- Audit trail for compliance and investigations
