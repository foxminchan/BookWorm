## Overview

This event represents an integration event when an order status is changed to complete. The `OrderStatusChangedToCompleteIntegrationEvent` is a domain event that captures the change of an order's status to complete in the Ordering bounded context. It carries the necessary value objects including the order identity, the new status, and the completion reason to notify the system about the status change. This event adheres to the ubiquitous language of our domain and serves as the contract between the Ordering and external systems, facilitating the transition from a pending order to a completed one.

| `TotalMoney` | `decimal` | Total monetary value of the completed order           |

## Workflow Context

This event plays an important role in the order completion workflow:

1. It is published by the Ordering service when an order is successfully completed

3. The event triggers the transition to the Completed state in the Finance service
4. It may initiate follow-up processes like customer notifications or analytics updates

- **Ordering → Finance**: Notifies about order completion
- **Finance → Notification**: May trigger completion notifications to customers
