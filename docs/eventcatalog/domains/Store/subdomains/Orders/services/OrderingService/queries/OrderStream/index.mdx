## Overview

The Order Stream service provides a real-time WebSocket connection for users to interact with the BookWorm platform's order management system. It allows users to receive real-time updates on order events, enabling dynamic interactions and monitoring of order statuses.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## WebSocket `wss://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/orders/stream`

The Order Stream service uses WebSocket for real-time communication. Users can connect to the WebSocket endpoint to send and receive order-related events.

### Example Usage

```js title="order-stream.js"
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
	.withUrl("wss://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/orders/stream", {
		accessTokenFactory: () => "your-access-token"
	})
	.build();

await connection.start();
connection.on("OrderCreated", (order) => {
	console.log("New order created:", order);
});

connection.on("OrderUpdated", (order) => {
	console.log("Order updated:", order);
});

connection.on("OrderDeleted", (orderId) => {
	console.log("Order deleted:", orderId);
});

connection.onclose(() => {
	console.log("Connection closed");
});

connection.onreconnected(() => {
	console.log("Reconnected to the order stream");
});
```

## Event Types

The Order Stream service supports the following event types:

- `OrderPlaced`: Triggered when a new order is placed.
- `OrderCompleted`: Triggered when an order is completed.
- `OrderCancelled`: Triggered when an order is cancelled.
