## Overview

The Notification Database is the persistence layer for the Notification Service, managing the complete lifecycle of transactional email communications in the BookWorm e-commerce system. Built on PostgreSQL 18, this database implements a custom email outbox pattern alongside MassTransit's standard outbox/inbox tables, ensuring reliable email delivery with comprehensive audit trails. It serves as the authoritative source for all customer notification attempts, tracking creation, delivery status, and retention for compliance and debugging purposes.

## Database Purpose & Role

### Email Outbox Pattern

The Notification Database implements a specialized email outbox pattern for reliable email delivery:

- **Atomic Storage**: Email data stored transactionally with event processing
- **Guaranteed Delivery**: Emails persist until successfully sent
- **Retry Management**: Failed emails remain in outbox for retry attempts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all email communications
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate email sends through deduplication

### Transactional Messaging Integration

The database integrates with MassTransit for event-driven communication:

- **Inbox Pattern**: Deduplicates incoming order events
- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures atomic event processing and email creation
- **Message Correlation**: Links emails to originating order events
- **Fault Tolerance**: Survives service restarts and network failures

### Compliance & Auditing

Long-term retention supports business and regulatory requirements:

- **Communication History**: 7-year retention of all sent emails
- **Customer Service**: Historical reference for support inquiries
- **Dispute Resolution**: Evidence of notification delivery
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to access communication history
- **Business Analytics**: Email delivery metrics and trends

## Schema Design

### Core Tables

#### `outboxes` - Email Outbox Queue

The primary table storing pending and sent transactional emails with the following columns:

- **id** (uuid, PRIMARY KEY): Unique email identifier
- **to_name** (varchar(100), NOT NULL, DEFAULT ''): Recipient's full name
- **to_email** (varchar(255), NOT NULL, DEFAULT ''): Recipient's email address
- **subject** (varchar(100), NOT NULL, DEFAULT ''): Email subject line
- **body** (varchar(10000), NOT NULL, DEFAULT ''): Email body content (HTML or plain text)
- **is_sent** (boolean, NOT NULL): Delivery status flag
- **sequence_number** (bigint, IDENTITY, NOT NULL): Auto-incrementing sequence for processing order
- **created_at** (timestamptz, NOT NULL): When email was created
- **sent_at** (timestamptz): When email was successfully delivered

**Key Features**:
- **Sequence Number**: Ensures FIFO processing of emails
- **Status Tracking**: Boolean flag for quick filtering of pending emails
- **Timestamp Audit**: Creation and delivery times for SLA monitoring
- **Recipient Info**: Both name and email for personalized delivery
- **Content Storage**: Complete email content for retry and audit purposes

**Email Lifecycle**:
- Created: Email added to outbox with is_sent = false
- Processing: Background worker picks up emails by sequence_number
- Sent: Email delivered successfully, is_sent = true, sent_at = current timestamp
- Failed: Email remains with is_sent = false for retry (with exponential backoff)

#### `outbox_message` - MassTransit Transactional Outbox

Stores integration events to be published, ensuring atomic email creation and event publishing with the following columns:

- **sequence_number** (bigint, PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY): Auto-incrementing sequence
- **message_id** (uuid, NOT NULL): Unique message identifier
- **message_type** (text, NOT NULL): Full message type name
- **body** (text, NOT NULL): Serialized message content (JSON)
- **content_type** (varchar(256), NOT NULL): Serialization format
- **enqueue_time** (timestamptz): When message was stored
- **sent_time** (timestamptz, NOT NULL): When message was published
- **conversation_id** (uuid): Conversation tracking
- **correlation_id** (uuid): Event correlation ID
- **initiator_id** (uuid): Original message initiator
- **request_id** (uuid): Request-response tracking

- **properties** (text): Custom message properties (JSON)
- **inbox_message_id** (uuid): Related inbox message (foreign key)
- **inbox_consumer_id** (uuid): Related inbox consumer (foreign key)
- **outbox_id** (uuid): Related outbox state (foreign key)

**Key Features**:
- **Sequential Processing**: Ensures message ordering
- **Complete Envelope**: All routing and correlation metadata
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Links to inbox_state and outbox_state for consistency
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks enqueue and delivery times

#### `outbox_state` - Outbox Processing State

Tracks the current position of outbox message processing with the following columns:

- **outbox_id** (uuid, PRIMARY KEY): Unique outbox identifier
- **lock_id** (uuid, NOT NULL): Distributed lock identifier
- **row_version** (bytea): Optimistic concurrency token
- **created** (timestamptz, NOT NULL): Outbox creation time
- **delivered** (timestamptz): Last delivery time
- **last_sequence_number** (bigint): Last processed message sequence

**Key Features**:
- **Processing Cursor**: Tracks last processed message
- **Distributed Locking**: Prevents concurrent processing by multiple workers
- **Recovery Support**: Enables resume from last sequence after failures

#### `inbox_state` - Message Deduplication

Tracks consumed order events to ensure idempotent email creation with the following columns:

- **id** (bigint, PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY): Internal identifier

- **consumed** (timestamptz): When message was processed
- **delivered** (timestamptz): When processing completed
- **last_sequence_number** (bigint): Sequence tracking
- **UNIQUE CONSTRAINT** on (message_id, consumer_id): Deduplication key

**Key Features**:
- **Idempotency Guarantee**: Prevents duplicate email creation from retried events
- **Composite Uniqueness**: Per-consumer deduplication
- **Retry Tracking**: Monitors delivery attempts
- **Lifecycle Timestamps**: Full message processing history

#### `__EFMigrationsHistory` - Schema Version Control

Standard Entity Framework Core migrations table with the following columns:

- **migration_id** (varchar(150), PRIMARY KEY): Migration identifier
- **product_version** (varchar(32), NOT NULL): EF Core version

Tracks applied database migrations for schema evolution management.

## Data Flow & Integration

### Email Creation Flow

**1. Order Event Received**
- PlaceOrderCommand, CompleteOrderCommand, or CancelOrderCommand arrives via RabbitMQ
- MassTransit checks inbox_state for duplicate detection
- If new message, insert into inbox_state and proceed
- If duplicate, skip processing

**2. Email Composition**
- Event data extracted (order ID, customer name, email, order details)
- Email template rendered with dynamic data
- MIME message constructed with HTML body
- Outbox entity created with recipient info and content

**3. Transactional Storage**
- INSERT into outboxes table (email details)
- INSERT into outbox_message table (event acknowledgment if needed)
- Transaction COMMIT (atomic write)
- Email now guaranteed to be sent eventually

**4. Background Processing**
- Background worker polls outboxes WHERE is_sent = false ORDER BY sequence_number
- Email picked up for delivery
- SMTP send attempted via MailKit to SendGrid or MailPit
- On success: UPDATE outboxes SET is_sent = true, sent_at = NOW()
- On failure: Email remains pending for retry

### Retry Strategy

**Exponential Backoff**:
- First retry: 5 minutes after failure
- Second retry: 15 minutes after first retry
- Third retry: 1 hour after second retry
- Max retries: 5 attempts over 24 hours
- After max retries: Email flagged for manual intervention

**Failure Handling**:
- Transient failures (network, SMTP server down): Automatic retry
- Permanent failures (invalid email, blocked recipient): Manual review
- Rate limiting: Throttle processing to avoid SendGrid limits

### Cleanup & Archival

**Sent Email Cleanup**:
- CleanUpSentEmailIntegrationEvent triggers periodic cleanup
- Emails with is_sent = true and sent_at older than retention period are archived
- Archived emails moved to cold storage (Azure Blob or data lake)
- DELETE from outboxes table to manage database size

**Retention Strategy**:
- Active emails (unsent or recent): Kept in primary database
- Sent emails (recent 90 days): Kept in primary database for quick access
- Historical emails (90 days - 7 years): Archived to warm storage
- Compliance records (7+ years): Compressed in cold storage

## Performance & Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

**Critical Indexes**:
- Primary keys (automatically indexed): outboxes(id), outbox_message(sequence_number), outbox_state(outbox_id), inbox_state(id)
- Unique constraints (automatically indexed): inbox_state(message_id, consumer_id)
- Recommended additional indexes: idx_outboxes_is_sent (on is_sent WHERE is_sent = false), idx_outboxes_sequence (on sequence_number), idx_outboxes_created_at (on created_at)

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Email Lookup**: O(1) via primary key (id)
- **Pending Email Query**: O(log n) via is_sent index
- **Sequential Processing**: O(1) via sequence_number index
- **Inbox Deduplication**: O(1) via unique constraint

### Query Patterns

**High-Frequency Queries**:
1. **Get Pending Emails**: Select emails WHERE is_sent = false ORDER BY sequence_number LIMIT batch_size
2. **Check Duplicate Event**: Existence check in inbox_state by (message_id, consumer_id)
3. **Mark Email Sent**: UPDATE outboxes SET is_sent = true, sent_at = NOW() WHERE id = ?

**Write Patterns**:
- **Insert Email**: Single INSERT per order event
- **Update Email Status**: Single UPDATE after successful send
- **Bulk Cleanup**: Batch DELETE for old sent emails (daily maintenance)

### Database Sizing

**Estimated Growth** (per 1,000 orders/day, assuming 1 email per order):
- **outboxes**: ~500 KB/day (500 bytes/row × 1,000 rows)
- **outbox_message**: ~1.5 MB/day (purged after 7 days)
- **inbox_state**: ~500 KB/day (purged after 30 days)

**Annual Storage** (with retention):
- **outboxes**: ~180 MB/year (retained for 7 years = 1.26 GB)
- **outbox_message**: ~10.5 MB (rolling 7-day window)
- **inbox_state**: ~15 MB (rolling 30-day window)

**Total Database Size** (7-year retention): ~1.5 GB + indexes (~3 GB total)

## Data Lifecycle & Retention

### Retention Policy

- **outboxes**: 7 years (business and compliance requirements)
- **outbox_message**: 7 days (after successful delivery)
- **inbox_state**: 30 days (deduplication window)
- **outbox_state**: Indefinite (small metadata table)

### Archival Strategy

**Hot Storage** (Active Database):
- Unsent emails (pending delivery)
- Recently sent emails (last 90 days)
- Active inbox/outbox message records

**Warm Storage** (Archive Database or Blob):
- Sent emails (90 days - 2 years)
- Queryable for customer service
- Indexed for fast retrieval

**Cold Storage** (Data Lake):
- Historical emails (2+ years)
- Compressed archives for compliance
- Rarely accessed, batch retrieval only

### Cleanup Jobs

**Automated Maintenance**:
- **Daily**: Purge old outbox_message records (sent more than 7 days ago)
- **Weekly**: Purge old inbox_state records (consumed more than 30 days ago)
- **Monthly**: Archive sent emails (sent more than 2 years ago) to cold storage
- **Quarterly**: Vacuum database to reclaim space from deleted records

## Monitoring & Observability

- Alert if no emails sent in last 15 minutes (worker may be down)

### Logging & Tracing

**Structured Logging**:
- Email creation logged with order_id and recipient email (masked)
- Delivery attempts logged with SMTP response codes
- Failures logged with error details and retry count
- Cleanup operations logged with record counts

**Distributed Tracing**:
- OpenTelemetry spans for email processing
- Correlation IDs link email to originating order event
- End-to-end tracing from order event to email delivery

   - Graceful degradation: Queue emails in memory temporarily

2. **Email Provider Outage**:
   - Emails remain in outbox with is_sent = false
   - Automatic retry when provider recovers
   - Failover to backup SMTP provider if configured

3. **Complete Database Loss**:
   - Failover to geo-redundant replica (RTO approximately 1 hour)
   - Restore from latest backup snapshot
   - Unsent emails are preserved and automatically retried

**Recovery Testing**:
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Automated backup restoration tests
