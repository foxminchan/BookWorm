## Overview

The Scheduler Database is a PostgreSQL 18-based persistent storage system that powers the job scheduling and task automation infrastructure for the BookWorm platform. This database manages both time-based (one-time and recurring) and cron-based scheduled tasks, ensuring reliable execution of background jobs, maintenance routines, batch processes, and automated workflows. By maintaining a comprehensive record of scheduled tasks, their execution history, and retry logic, the system provides a robust foundation for automated operations that keep the platform running smoothly 24/7.

## Purpose & Responsibility

The Scheduler Database serves as the backbone for all automated and scheduled operations in the BookWorm ecosystem, enabling:

- **Automated Task Execution**: Running background jobs at specified times or intervals
- **Recurring Operations**: Managing periodic tasks like data cleanup, report generation, and cache warming
- **Cron-Based Scheduling**: Supporting complex scheduling patterns using cron expressions
- **Job Orchestration**: Coordinating batch jobs with dependencies and parent-child relationships
- **Reliability & Resilience**: Handling failures with retry logic and exception tracking
- **Execution Tracking**: Maintaining detailed history of job runs for audit and debugging
- **Distributed Locking**: Preventing concurrent execution across multiple service instances
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking execution times and job performance metrics

This database transforms manual, time-sensitive operations into reliable, automated processes that improve operational efficiency and reduce human error.

## Schema Design

The database employs a sophisticated schema designed around two primary scheduling paradigms: time-based triggers and cron-based patterns, all housed within a dedicated `ticker` schema for organizational clarity.

<Schema file="schema.sql" lang="sql" title="Scheduler Database Schema" />

### Architecture Overview

The scheduler system is built on two complementary scheduling models:

**1. TimeTickers**: One-time or batch scheduled tasks

- Execute at a specific point in time
- Support batch operations with parent-child relationships
- Ideal for one-off jobs or scheduled task chains
- Examples: Order processing, report generation, data exports

**2. CronTickers**: Recurring scheduled tasks based on cron expressions

- Execute on repeating schedules (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.)
- Generate CronTickerOccurrences for each scheduled run
- Ideal for periodic maintenance and monitoring
- Examples: Cache cleanup, analytics aggregation, health checks

### CronTickers Table

Defines recurring scheduled tasks using cron expressions.

#### Key Columns

**`id` (UUID, Primary Key)**

- Unique identifier for the cron schedule definition
- Permanent reference across all occurrences
- Links to CronTickerOccurrences for execution tracking

**`expression` (TEXT)**

## Key Features

### Distributed Locking

The database implements pessimistic locking to prevent concurrent execution:

**Lock Acquisition:**

```sql
UPDATE ticker."TimeTickers"
SET status = 1,  -- Locked
    lock_holder = 'service-instance-123',
    locked_at = NOW()
WHERE id = $1
    AND status = 0  -- Pending
    AND execution_time <= NOW()
    AND (lock_holder IS NULL OR locked_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes')
RETURNING *;
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents duplicate execution in multi-instance deployments
- Handles crashed instances via lock timeout
- No external coordination service needed
- Database-native locking mechanism

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

Failed jobs automatically retry with configurable intervals:

**Retry Strategy:**

```
Attempt 1: Immediate execution
Attempt 2: Wait 60 seconds (1 minute)
Attempt 3: Wait 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Attempt 4: Wait 900 seconds (15 minutes)
Final: Mark as failed, alert operations team
```

**Implementation:**

- `retry_count` tracks current attempt
- `retry_intervals` array defines wait times
- Next execution_time = NOW() + retry_intervals[retry_count]
- Automatic abandonment after max retries

### Batch Job Orchestration

TimeTickers support parent-child relationships for complex workflows:

**Example Workflow:**

```
Parent: GenerateMonthlyReport
├── Child 1: ExtractSalesData (run if parent succeeds)
├── Child 2: ExtractInventoryData (run if parent succeeds)
├── Child 3: CompileReport (run if all children succeed)
└── Child 4: SendFailureAlert (run only if parent fails)
```

**Batch Conditions:**

- Sequential execution based on parent status
- Parallel execution for independent children
- Conditional execution based on outcomes
- Dependency resolution and workflow orchestration

### Cron Expression Scheduling

CronTickers support standard cron syntax:

**Common Patterns:**

```
*/5 * * * *          - Every 5 minutes
0 * * * *            - Every hour at minute 0
0 0 * * *            - Daily at midnight
0 2 * * *            - Daily at 2 AM
0 9 * * MON-FRI      - Weekdays at 9 AM
0 0 1 * *            - Monthly on the 1st at midnight
0 0 * * SUN          - Every Sunday at midnight
0 */6 * * *          - Every 6 hours
*/15 9-17 * * MON-FRI - Every 15 minutes during business hours
```

### Execution History & Audit Trail

Complete tracking of all job executions:

**Tracked Metrics:**

- Execution time vs scheduled time (latency)
- Duration of execution (performance)
- Success/failure outcomes
- Error messages and stack traces
- Retry attempts and outcomes
- Lock holder information

## Data Classification & Governance

- **Classification**: Internal - Operational data for system automation
