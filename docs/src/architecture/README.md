# arc42 Architecture Documentation

This section contains the detailed architecture documentation for BookWorm following the arc42 template structure.

## About arc42

arc42 is a template for documentation and communication of software and system architectures. It provides a consistent structure for documenting architectures that is:

- **Pragmatic** - focuses on content, not form
- **Flexible** - adaptable to your specific needs
- **Clear** - well-structured and easy to navigate
- **Comprehensive** - covers all important aspects

## Documentation Sections

The architecture documentation is organized into 12 main sections:

1. **[Introduction and Goals](01-introduction-goals.md)** - Why does this system exist?
2. **[Constraints](02-constraints.md)** - What are the fixed constraints?
3. **[Context and Scope](03-context-scope.md)** - What are the system boundaries?
4. **[Solution Strategy](04-solution-strategy.md)** - How do we achieve our goals?
5. **[Building Block View](05-building-block-view.md)** - How is the system structured?
6. **[Runtime View](06-runtime-view.md)** - How does the system behave at runtime?
7. **[Deployment View](07-deployment-view.md)** - How is the system deployed?
8. **[Cross-cutting Concepts](08-cross-cutting-concepts.md)** - What are the overarching concepts?
9. **[Architecture Decisions](09-architecture-decisions.md)** - What are the key decisions?
10. **[Quality Requirements](10-quality-requirements.md)** - What quality attributes matter?
11. **[Risks and Technical Debt](11-risks-technical-debt.md)** - What are the known issues?
12. **[Glossary](12-glossary.md)** - What do the terms mean?

Each section provides detailed information about different aspects of the BookWorm architecture, from high-level goals to specific implementation details.
