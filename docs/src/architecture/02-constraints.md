# 2. Architecture Constraints

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

### Platform and Technology Stack

| Constraint | Description | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **.NET 9** | Latest .NET framework | Access to newest features and performance improvements |
| **C# 13** | Latest C# language version | Modern language features and best practices |
| **.NET Aspire** | Cloud-native application framework | Simplified cloud-native development and deployment |
| **Azure Container Apps** | Primary deployment target | Managed container service with auto-scaling |
| **Docker/Podman** | Containerization platform | Consistent deployment across environments |

### Development Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Domain-Driven Design** | Mandatory architectural approach | Influences service boundaries and model design |
| **Vertical Slice Architecture** | Required code organization | Affects project structure and feature implementation |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Required communication pattern | Impacts service interaction and data consistency |
| **CQRS Pattern** | Command Query Responsibility Segregation | Separates read and write operations |
| **OpenAPI/AsyncAPI** | API documentation standards | All APIs must be properly documented |

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

### Development Process

- **Open Source Development**: Public repository with community contributions
- **MIT License**: Permissive licensing for maximum flexibility
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- **Code Quality**: SonarCloud integration for code quality metrics
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and load testing

### Documentation Requirements

- **Architecture Documentation**: arc42 template compliance
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI for REST APIs, AsyncAPI for events
- **Event Catalog**: Centralized event-driven architecture documentation
- **Deployment Guides**: Comprehensive deployment instructions

## 2.3 Conventions and Standards

### Coding Standards

- **EditorConfig**: Consistent code formatting across the project
- **C# Coding Conventions**: Microsoft C# coding standards
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Enabled for better null safety
- **Pattern Matching**: Preferred over traditional conditional logic

### Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Application | Justification |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Microservices** | Service decomposition | Scalability and independent deployment |
| **Event Sourcing** | Domain events storage | Audit trail and temporal queries |
| **Outbox Pattern** | Reliable event publishing | Ensures message delivery consistency |
| **Inbox Pattern** | Idempotent message processing | Prevents duplicate message processing |
| **Saga Pattern** | Distributed transactions | Manages long-running business processes |

## 2.4 Infrastructure Constraints

### Deployment Environment

- **Azure Cloud**: Primary cloud provider
- **Container-based**: All services deployed as containers
- **Managed Services**: Preference for managed Azure services
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure provisioning

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: Keycloak for identity management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **Secret Management**: Azure Key Vault for sensitive configuration
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning

## 2.5 External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

| Service | Purpose | Constraint Impact |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Keycloak** | Identity and access management | Authentication architecture dependency |
| **SendGrid** | Email delivery service | Email functionality limitation |
| **Azure Services** | Cloud infrastructure | Platform-specific implementation |
| **AI Models** | Nomic Embed Text, Gemma 3 | GPU requirements for local development |

### Hardware Requirements

- **GPU Support**: Required for AI components in local development
- **Container Runtime**: Docker or Podman for local development
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM for full local development setup
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for optimal performance
