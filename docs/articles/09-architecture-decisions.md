### ADR-002: Implement Microservices with Domain-Driven Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-20  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Product Team  

#### Context
Need to organize the system architecture to support independent development, deployment, and scaling of business capabilities.

#### Decision
Implement microservices architecture aligned with Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts.

#### Rationale
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of different business functions
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technologies
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to others
- **Business Alignment**: Services align with business domains

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better scalability, team independence, technology choices
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, network latency, data consistency challenges
- **Mitigations**: Service mesh, event-driven patterns, monitoring tools

### ADR-003: Use Event-Driven Architecture for Service Communication

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-25  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  

#### Context
Services need to communicate and stay synchronized while maintaining loose coupling.

#### Decision
Implement event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

#### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need to know about each other directly
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing improves system throughput
- **Resilience**: System continues to function even if some services are down
- **Audit Trail**: Events provide natural audit log
- **Integration**: Easy to add new services and integrations

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better decoupling, resilience, and scalability
- **Negative**: Eventual consistency, debugging complexity
- **Mitigations**: Event sourcing, distributed tracing, monitoring

### ADR-004: Implement CQRS Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-02-01  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

#### Context
Need to optimize read and write operations independently and handle complex business logic.

#### Decision
Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using MediatR.

#### Rationale
- **Performance Optimization**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of read and write operations
- **Complexity Management**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Event Integration**: Natural fit with event-driven architecture

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better performance, clearer code structure, optimized queries
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, potential data synchronization issues
- **Mitigations**: Eventual consistency patterns, comprehensive testing

---

### ADR-005: Use Vertical Slice Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-02-05  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

#### Context
Need to organize code within services to minimize coupling and maximize cohesion.

#### Decision
Organize service code using Vertical Slice Architecture instead of traditional layered architecture.

#### Rationale
- **Feature Focus**: Each feature has all its code in one place
- **Reduced Coupling**: Less dependency between different parts of the system
- **Faster Development**: Easier to add new features without affecting existing ones
- **Testing**: Each slice can be tested independently

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Faster feature development, better maintainability, clearer boundaries
- **Negative**: Potential code duplication, different from traditional patterns
- **Mitigations**: Shared building blocks, code review practices
