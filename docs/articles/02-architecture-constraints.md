# 2. Architecture Constraints

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

### Platform and Runtime Constraints
| Constraint | Description | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **.NET 9.0** | Latest .NET framework version | Access to newest features and performance improvements |
| **.NET Aspire** | Cloud-native development framework | Simplified development of distributed applications |
| **C# 13** | Latest C# language features | Modern language constructs and improved developer productivity |
| **Docker/Podman** | Container runtime required | Consistent deployment across environments |

### Database Constraints
| Technology | Usage | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary data storage | ACID compliance, JSON support, excellent .NET integration |
| **Redis** | Caching layer | High-performance in-memory data structure store |
| **Qdrant** | Vector database | AI/ML embeddings storage for search functionality |

### Messaging and Communication
| Technology | Purpose | Constraint Reason |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **RabbitMQ** | Event bus messaging | Reliable message delivery and routing |
| **gRPC** | Service-to-service communication | High-performance, type-safe inter-service calls |
| **HTTP/REST** | External API interfaces | Standard web API protocols |

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

### Development Constraints
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment
- **Code Quality**: SonarCloud for static analysis
- **Documentation**: EventCatalog for API documentation, arc42 for architecture
- **Testing**: Unit tests, architecture tests, load testing with k6

### Deployment Constraints
- **Container Orchestration**: Support for Kubernetes deployment
- **Cloud Platforms**: Azure-first approach with multi-cloud capability
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated provisioning and configuration
- **Monitoring**: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) integration

## 2.3 Security Constraints

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Identity Provider**: Keycloak for centralized authentication
- **API Security**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and connection strings

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for user data handling
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Code Security**: Static security analysis with tools like Gitleaks

## 2.4 Performance Constraints

### Response Time Requirements
- **API Responses**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for standard operations
- **UI Interactions**: < 2 seconds for page loads

### Throughput Requirements
- **Concurrent Users**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Order Processing**: Handle 100+ orders per minute
- **Search Operations**: Sub-second search results

## 2.5 Scalability Constraints

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Services**: All services must be stateless for horizontal scaling
- **Database Sharding**: Support for database partitioning if needed
- **Caching Strategy**: Distributed caching for improved performance

### Resource Constraints
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize for cloud-native resource allocation
- **Storage**: Efficient data storage patterns to minimize costs
- **Network**: Minimize inter-service communication overhead
