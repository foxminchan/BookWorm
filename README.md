# üìñ BookWorm: A Practical .NET Aspire Application

## Introduction

<p align="justify">
‚≠ê BookWorm demonstrates the practical implementation of .NET Aspire in a cloud-native application. The project employs Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Vertical Slice Architecture to organize the codebase effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)

### System Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> AI components require an **Nvidia GPU** for local development. Email services use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) in production and [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) locally.

### Run the Application

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:foxminchan/BookWorm.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the repository

   ```bash
   cd BookWorm
   ```

3. Run the application

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> Docker or Podman must be running on your machine before starting the application.

### Deploy the application

For detailed deployment instructions, please consult the [deployment guide](./deploys/README.md).
