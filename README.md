- [Aspire CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/cli/install)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Optional: [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
- Optional: [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - üìß Email services use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) in production and [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) locally
> - üçé Mac with Apple Silicon users need [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527) for grpc-tools compatibility
> - üê≥ Docker Desktop must be running before starting the application

### Run the Application

Follow these steps to get BookWorm running locally:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:foxminchan/BookWorm.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd BookWorm

# 3. Run the application (starts all services)
just run
```

> [!TIP]
>
> - Run `just help` to see all available commands.

### Deploy the Application

To deploy BookWorm to Azure Container Apps, follow these steps:

1. **Authenticate with Azure**:

```sh
az login
```

2. **Deploy the application**:

```sh
aspire deploy
```

3. **Verify the deployment**:

After deployment completes, get the application URL:

```sh
az containerapp show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn --output tsv
```

Replace `<app-name>` and `<resource-group>` with the values you specified during deployment.

4. **Clean up resources**:

To remove all deployed resources and avoid charges:

```sh
az group delete --name <resource-group> --yes --no-wait
```
