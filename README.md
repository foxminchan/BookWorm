# üìñ BookWorm: A Practical .NET Aspire Application

## Introduction

<p align="justify">
‚≠ê BookWorm demonstrates the practical implementation of .NET Aspire in a cloud-native application. The project employs Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Vertical Slice Architecture to organize the codebase effectively.

## Project Architecture

BookWorm is structured as a microservices-based application with the following services:

- **Catalog**: Book inventory and metadata management.
- **Basket**: Shopping cart functionality.
- **Ordering**: Order processing and fulfillment.
- **Notification**: Handles email notifications as a Worker Service.
- **Rating**: Book review and rating system.
- **Finance**: Orchestration service for basket reservation and order processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A device with an Nvidia GPU
- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/) & [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) & [helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### System Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **AI Components**: This project uses [DeepSeek R1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) for chatbot integration and [Nomic Embed Text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) for text embedding, requiring an **Nvidia GPU** for local development.
> - **Email Services**: Production uses [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), while local development uses [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) for email testing.

### Run the Application

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:foxminchan/BookWorm.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the repository

   ```bash
   cd BookWorm
   ```

3. Run the application
