# üìñ BookWorm: A Practical .NET Aspire Application

## Introduction

<p align="justify">
‚≠ê BookWorm demonstrates the practical implementation of .NET Aspire in a cloud-native application. The project employs Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Vertical Slice Architecture to organize the codebase effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)

### System Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **AI Components**: This project uses [DeepSeek R1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) for chatbot integration and [Nomic Embed Text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) for text embedding, requiring an **Nvidia GPU** for local development.
> - **Email Services**: Production uses [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), while local development uses [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) for email testing.
