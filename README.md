# üìñ BookWorm: A Practical .NET Aspire Application

## Introduction

<p align="justify">
‚≠ê BookWorm demonstrates the practical implementation of .NET Aspire in a cloud-native application. The project employs Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Vertical Slice Architecture to organize the codebase effectively.

## Project Architecture

BookWorm is structured as a microservices-based application with the following services:

- **Catalog**: Book inventory management with search and pagination
- **Basket**: Shopping cart functionality
- **Ordering**: Order processing and fulfillment
- **Identity**: User authentication and profile management
- **Notification**: Email notification services (Worker Service)
- **Rating**: Book review and rating system
- **Finance**: Orchestration service for basket reservation and order processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A device with an Nvidia GPU
- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/) & [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this project, we use [DeepSeek R1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) & [Nomic Embed Text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text). So, you must have an Nvidia GPU to run the application.
>
> In Production, we use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for email services. But, for local development, we use [Mailpit](https://mailpit.io/).

### Run the Application

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:foxminchan/BookWorm.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the repository

   ```bash
   cd BookWorm
   ```

3. Run the application

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> Docker must be running on your machine before starting the application.

### Deploy the Application

There are two ways to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster using `Aspirate`:

- **Method 1:** Deploy to `Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)`:

  ```bash
  bash ./deploys/scripts/deploy.sh
  ```

- **Method 2:** Deploy to `k3d`:

  ```bash
  dotnet aspire apply --non-interactive -p ./src/BookWorm.AppHost
  ```
